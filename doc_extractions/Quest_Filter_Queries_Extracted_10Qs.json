            "Armed Insurrection (German: Der bewaffnete Aufstand) is a book published by the Comintern in Germany under the pseudonym of A. Neuberg, written as a kind of textbook on the theory of organizing an armed insurrection.\nThe book was prepared by an instructor of the military apparatus of the Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands (\"Communist Party of Germany\", KPD) and an agent of the intelligence department of the Red Army, August Gailis. It was originally published in German (\"Der bewaffnete Aufstand\", 1928), followed three years later by translations into French (\"L\u2019insurrection arm\u00e9e\", 1931) and Russian (\"\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0451\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\", 1931). In 1932, Spanish Trotskyists published a Spanish translation without the knowledge of the Comintern.\n\n\n== Contents and significance ==\nAccording to Mao, a revolutionary or resistance war can be fought according to the doctrine of protracted war. This doctrine includes three consecutive phases. The first is the \"pre-revolutionary phase\" (or pre-resistance), in which the rebels organize themselves, train, equip themselves, form command cadres, create their own safe bases \u2013 the so-called \"sanctuaries\" \u2013 in the most remote and inaccessible areas of the country (or across the border, in a friendly or at least neutral country) for the purpose of storing and producing critical materials, create their own logistics network, their own encrypted communication system, etc. The second phase is that of the \"strategic stalemate\", or a long war of attrition that can last years or decades, characterized by proper guerrilla operations, aimed at demoralizing and increasingly wearing down the enemy: killings of isolated soldiers and policemen; sniping; ambushes against patrols and moving columns; raids against small units and military garrisons; sabotage and destruction of vehicles, depots and installations; seizing of weapons and ammunition; etc. The third and final phase is that of the \u201cstrategic counteroffensive\u201d, in which the guerrillas, after having managed to sufficiently damage the enemy and after having accumulated adequate forces in terms of men, weapons and means, can come out into the open to transform themselves into a real regular army, capable of engaging and defeating the enemy by means of conventional tactics and battles, until the final victory.\nThe contents of the book Armed Insurrection have greater relevance to the third and final phase of a revolutionary war, contrary to other similar books \u2013 such as Guerrilla Warfare by 'Che' Guevara or as the Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla by Marighella \u2013 which instead focus on the second.\nArmed Insurrection deals with theory, practice and historical examples relating to an insurgent force that attempts to take definitive control of a territory \u2013 for example a city \u2013 by conquering arsenals, barracks, police stations, telecommunication centers, administrative centers, factories, railway stations, bridges, roads, etc. and then defending them from a possible enemy counterattack.\nEngels, considering the revolutionary events of 1848 in Germany, described the passage from armed rebellion to the formation of a real revolutionary army, thus raising the question \u2013 extremely relevant for radical left-wing politics between the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th century \u2013 of the transformation of spontaneous popular uprisings into armed forces capable of organized opposition to power. Armed Insurrection is a further development of this theme, which makes the book extremely interesting from the point of view of understanding the ideas spread among the leaders of the Comintern about armed insurrection, considered as the highest and \u00absupreme form\u00bb of political struggle of the proletariat against the state power of the bourgeoisie, to be \u00abconducted according to the rules of military science\u00bb, so that \u00abit presupposes a plan of campaign, offensive fighting operations and unbounded devotion and heroism on the part of the proletariat\u00bb. The book Armed Insurrection was written at a time when the leadership of the Third International (Comintern) and the Soviet Communist Party considered it possible to implement the idea of world revolution in the form of armed insurrections in individual countries.\nAccording to J\u00f6rg H\u00fclsmann, Armed Insurrection was probably the first systematic study of the suitability of guerrilla methods for establishing communist states.\nMichael Hardt and Antonio Negri evaluated Armed Insurrection as follows:\n\nThis remarkable book, originally published in German in 1928, gives a rare inside view of communist military strategy in the early twentieth century.\n\n\n== Authorship ==\nIn 1933, a book by Nazi propagandist Adolf Erth was published, translated into many European languages, titled: \u201cArmed Insurrection: Revelations of the Communist Coup Attempt on the Eve of the National Revolution\u201d, in which it was claimed that Neuberg was the pseudonym of a major figure in the German Communist movement, Heinz Neumann. Erth's version became generally accepted in the anti-Communist literature of the 1950s and 1960s, being repeated in dozens of books, including in the memoirs of Chiang Kai-shek.\nIn 1970 in Italy and England, and in 1971 in Germany, three new editions of Neuberg's book were published, accompanied by introductory notes by former Comintern figure Erich Wollenberg, in which he named the \"real authors\" of the book: himself, as well as Vasily Blyukher, Hans Kippenberger, Osip Piatnitsky, Palmiro Togliatti, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, J\u00f3zef Unszlicht, Ho Chi Minh and Manfred Stern.\nThis version has remained generally accepted, even though in the 1990s Comintern documents were published, according to which the real author of the book was the Soviet agent August Gailis (\"Neuberg\" was his pseudonym during his clandestine work in Germany), probably aided by Tuure Leh\u00e9n (an important Finnish communist and later Finnish-Soviet politician, as well as a philosopher, journalist and historian).\n\n\n== Structure ==\nOverall, the contents of Armed Insurrection are organized according to the following general index:\n\nIntroduction\n1. The Second International and Insurrection\n2. Bolshevism and Insurrection\n3. The Reval Uprising\n4. The Hamburg Uprising\n5. The Canton Insurrection\n6. The Shanghai Insurrections\n7. Communist Activity to Subvert the Armed Forces of the Ruling Classes\n8. The Organization of the Proletariat's Armed Forces\n9. The Direction of the Party's Military Work\n10. The Character of Military Action at the Beginning of the Insurrection\n11. The Character of the Insurgents' Operations during the Insurrection\n12. The Party's Military Work among the Peasants\nThe work has maps and diagrams.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunism\nGuerrilla warfare\nGuerrilla Warfare (Che Guevara book)\nInsurrection\nCommunist International\nLa Salute \u00e8 in voi!\nMinimanual of the Urban Guerrilla\nRevolution\nThe Anarchist Cookbook\nTM 31-210 Improvised Munitions Handbook\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA.

His motivation was partly a fear of the loss of precious manuscripts, such as the destruction of the library at Buda, by the Turks in 1526. He described the project in its title, as involving works \"extant and not, ancient and more recent down to the present day, learned and not, published and hiding in libraries\". He published the completed work in 1545 in Zurich, after some four years of research. At the time, he wrote \"In truth I rejoice and thank God because I have finally gotten out of the labyrinth in which I was trapped for almost three years\". It included his own bio-bibliography. Bibliotheca universalis was the first modern bibliography of importance published since the invention of printing, and through it, Gessner became known as the \"father of bibliography.\"\nThe work attempted to be an exhaustive survey of known writing in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and included approximately three thousand authors  The authors\u2019 forenames were listed alphabetically according to mediaeval usage, with a reverse index of their surnames. It was intended as an index by subject of all known authors. Gessner listed the writers together with the titles of their works, short biographies, and publication details including place of printing, printers and editors. He added his own annotations, comments, and evaluations of the nature and merit of every entry. It included about twelve thousand titles.\nGessner followed Johannes Trithemius\u2019s work of placing works in systems of cataloging. Gessner admired Trithemius\u2019s systems and used them as guidelines and templates; however Gessner carried the idea of cataloging and systems a step further. Theodore Besterman, in The Beginnings of Systematic Bibliography,   suggests that Gessner\u2019s work to organize knowledge was the forerunner of Francis Bacon\u2019s works and other encyclopedias that followed. Though called \"universal\", it was intended to be selective.\n\n\n== Pandectae (1548) ==\nIn 1548, Gessner followed this with a companion thematic index to Bibliotheca universalis, a large folio, Pandectarum sive Partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Tigurini, medici & philosophiae professoris, libri xxi (Pandectae).\n This contained thirty thousand topical entries. Each of these entries were cross-referenced to the appropriate author and book, arranged under headings and sub-headings, which were associated with various branches of learning.\nThe Pandectae had nineteen sections, each devoted to a scholarly discipline and contained dedications to the best scholar printers of Gessner's time. He listed their publications and accomplishments. The planned scope of 21 books was never completed, since part 20 De re medica was never published, and part 21 De theologia Christiana was published separately as Partitiones theologicae in 1549. A further supplement Appendix bibliothecae containing additions previously published separately by Lycosthenes (1551) and Simmler (1555) appeared in 1555.\nGessner made full use of any publishers' catalogues and booksellers' lists which were available in the 16th century that were printed when he was doing his research. These included use of printed catalogues supplied by firms like Aldus Manutius of Venice and Henri Estienne of Paris.\n\n\n== Bibliotheca selecta (1593) ==\nGessner's work, with its heterodox principles and advanced Protestant scholarship was a direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church which soon banned the work in the Index librorum prohibitorum. The Counter Reformation's response took another generation of Catholic scholarship to produce and appeared on the Vatican press in Rome in 1593 under the programmatic title, Bibliotheca selecta. This updated \"Anti-Gessner\" was assembled in 18 books covering the bibliography of the traditional scientific disciplines (Theology, 1-11, Law, 12, Philosophy, 13, Medicine, 14) and the liberal arts, 15\u201318, by the Mantuan Jesuit humanist and bibliographer Antonio Possevino.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",
            "The Black March (ISBN 0-553-20125-5) is an autobiography of a SS man published by Bantam Books. The book is a collection of key entries in the journal of Peter Neumann, a boy inducted from the Hitler Youth into the Schutzstaffel.\n\n\n== Publishing dates ==\n\n1956 - \u00c9ditions France-Empire; first published edition, in French; Title: SS!\n1958 - Weidenfeld & Nicolson Ltd; English translation by Constantine Fitzgibbon; Title:Other Men's Graves: Diary of an SS Man\n1959 - William Sloane Associates; First US printing; Title: The Black March: The Personal Story of an SS Man\n1960, 1967 - Bantam; Title: The Black March: The Personal Story of an SS Man\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe journal of Peter Neumann is presented in chronological order: it begins in 1939 with various entries of his activities in the Hitler youth, and discussing plans with his friends to enter the SS. Peter's early entries are more jubilant and optimistic.\nHe recounts his cruel training involving many life-or-death exercises, e.g., outrunning attack dogs, having to dig a fox hole before a tank rolls over him and the other men in training. He tells of how a few men died in such exercises. Peter's girlfriend reveals that she is a Jew; this, however, does not affect Peter negatively.\nDuring the middle of his entries he regards his duties with admiration and disdain for his commanding officers. Peter is, in one entry, awarded the Iron Cross second class for saving the lives of several battalions from a sniper's nest (who were also armed with RPGs).\nIn later entries, he tells of fierce combat in Russia, the most notable being a tale from a Russian civilian, in an occupied town, telling Peter and his fellow soldiers of the partisans of Odessa and the Russian genocide at the hands of the Nazis.\nTowards the end, Peter returns home on leave where he informs his friend's parents of their son's death, and on a visit to his home Peter is informed that his girlfriend has been moved to a ghetto. On visiting her he expresses sympathy for her condition but writes that he couldn't care less about other Jews in the same situation. He also talks with two concentration camp technicians at a bar, who tell him of their grisly job fixing incinerators.\nAt the end, Peter and his unit are on the retreat. Peter, at this point, has been promoted to captain and expresses extreme discontent with both the SS and with the many civilians who are blaming the SS for aggravating the Russian troops. He hears many tales of Russian cruelty. At the end, Peter is trapped, alone and wounded, and surrounded by Russian troops. He hides in a small room filled with dead German soldiers and fires a damaged gun at a Russian 'clean-up' squad. The bullet he intends for himself does not do the job.  His last words are \"Why couldn't they have killed me?\"\n\n\n== Additional notes ==\nThe book does not state explicitly whether Peter Neumann was captured, killed, or if he escaped. His last entry is somewhat long given the amount of time he had before the Russian troops could have reached him, and he could have disguised himself as a dead soldier. However, the final page of the book references being captured by the Soviet Army and being sent to Warsaw and working as a camp prisoner helping in the clean-up of the ruins left by the war.  The final page mentions the \"sneering brutality of the Soviet Guards\".\nSome have disputed the authenticity of Neumann's journal since its publication; some claiming it to have been the work of a ghost writer and therefore not autobiographical, and others claiming it to be a work of fiction. Peter Neumann's extraordinary tale has, nevertheless, held up very well under extensive examination in terms of historical accuracy by a number of sources since its publication.\nIt is also reported that French publisher \u00c9ditions France-Empire claimed that Peter Neumann's family (from whom they received the journal) specifically wanted the work kept intact\u2014as he wrote it during the war\u2014and that the family had not revised or altered the text before giving it to the publishers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNazi\nSchutzstaffel\nThe Holocaust\n\n\n== References ==",
            "The Christherre-Chronik (named after its opening words, \"Christ the Lord\") is a 13th-century world chronicle from Th\u00fcringen, written in Middle High German rhyming couplets.  It was written by a churchman in the service of Henry III, Margrave of Meissen, and may be seen as attempting a spiritual answer to the courtly world chronicle of Rudolf von Ems.  The work begins with the creation of the world and was apparently intended to follow world history until the poet's own day, but it was never finished.  It breaks off during the account of the book of judges, and in the manuscripts it is continued with text from other chronicles, including (ironically) that of Rudolf, and also sometimes the Weltchronik of Jans der Enikel.\nThere is still no edition of this text.

Since February 2005 it also appeared in print in Der Spiegel's monthly culture supplement. The column's title, literally 'onion fish', is a printers' term for a single character with an incorrect font in a block of text. The series consists of six volumes, all of which reached the top of the book sales lists, with the first volume selling more than 1.5 million copies within two years.\nThe title, Der Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod (English: the dative is the death of the genitive) is a way of saying Der Dativ ist der Tod des Genitivs  or Der Dativ ist des Genitivs Tod, a reference to a linguistic phenomenon in certain dialects of German where a noun in genitive case is replaced by a possessive adjective and noun in the dative case (see his genitive).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn several German states, articles from the books have been used officially as teaching materials, and\u2014according to Sick's foreword of August 2005, the series has been added to the set text list for the Abitur in Saarland. The material in the book series has been adapted into a DVD, a board game, a computer game and into audiobooks.\nOn the other hand, the linguists Vilmos \u00c1gel, Manfred Kaluza and Andr\u00e9 Meinunger think that Sick's books are not useful for teaching German because they contain factual errors, often just deal with irrelevant nitpicking, and don't give sufficient proof of why something Sick deems wrong should be wrong.\n\n\n== Book titles ==\nDer Dativ ist dem Genitiv sein Tod \u2013 Ein Wegweiser durch den Irrgarten der deutschen Sprache.

            "Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder is a two-volume book by Guido von List published in 1891. Its English translation is German Mythological Landscape Scenes.\nDuring 1877 and 1887, List had published various journalistic works on his earlier travels and mystical reflections on Loci (local spirits). Many of these pieces were anthologised in 1891 in his famous Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder.\nSome of the sketches in his sketchbook (which has drawings from as far back as 1863, when he would have been fifteen years old) demonstrate his interest in nature and ancient sites. Some of these sketches were later used to illustrate his Deutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder.\n\n\n== References ==\nDeutsch-Mythologische Landschaftsbilder\nIntroduction to the English translation of Das Geheimnis der Runen",
            "Deutsche Mythologie (German: [\u02c8d\u0254\u028ft\u0283\u0259 mytolo\u02c8\u0261i\u02d0], Teutonic Mythology) is a treatise on Germanic mythology by Jacob Grimm. First published in Germany in 1835, the work is an exhaustive treatment of the subject, tracing the mythology and beliefs of the ancient Germanic peoples from their earliest attestations to their survivals in modern traditions, folktales and popular expressions.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe structure of the Deutsche Mythologie is fairly encyclopaedic. The articles and chapters are discursive of philological, historical, folkloristic, and poetic aspects of the pre-Christian Germanic religions. The sources are varied epochally and geographically. In many instances, Grimm cites the North and West Germanic variants of a religious entity; thus the entry on Thor is titled 'Donar, Thunar (Th\u00f4rr)'. Older Germanic words, particularly those concerning ritual, are often compared to Latin equivalents, as evident in the table of contents.\n\n\n== Historiographical importance ==\nThe Deutsche Mythologie was an influential study; it has been called 'seminal, and largely unsurpassed'. Previous studies of Germanic mythology had tended to focus strictly on gods, whereas Grimm 'examined the totality of Germanic religious experience, from the creation narratives of the Prose Edda to the superstitions of the German peasant'. Grimm was not given to explicit discussions of method, but his study implies a set of 'buried theses' which were important to the development of scholarship on mythology: that the study of words as well as stories can reveal past belief-systems, and that 'just as Primitive Germanic word-forms could be \"reconstructed\" on a comparative basis, so could Primitive Germanic concepts, and the mythology in which they were embedded'. Grimm also assumed a 'thesis of continuity', whereby later sources could be seen as representations of earlier culture, due to the historical continuities between the two.\nHowever, Grimm's mythological methods have also been criticised extensively. Unlike his linguistic methods for reconstructing past languages, they were unable to produce scientifically falsifiable results. His findings have been shown to have been shaped by his own political leanings: some of his claims in the Deutsche Mythologie related to his views on the proper borders of a Unified Germany and particularly the Schleswig-Holstein Question; others were shaped by his sometimes strident anti-Catholic Protestant sentiments. The Deutsche Mythologie in fact implies a range of views on social questions:\n\nHe wanted to find a mythology which would not challenge the social structures of his own day, or would even reinforce the social structures which Grimm would have liked to see. It would accordingly have an organized pantheon of gods not dissimilar to the classical pantheon, with a clear sense of hierarchy [...] It would contain an element of philosophical profundity, centering on the concept of 'Fate' [...] There would be a healthy element of diversity in it, as shown by the eventually resolved rivalry of \u00c6sir and Vanir pantheons [...] and not too much sign of an organised priestly class \u2014 for Grimm was a Protestant [...] [G]ods and goddesses would also be respectably paired off and the latter would have strong connections with the household virtues [...] A strong element of nature-worship, especially of trees and groves, was also a desideratum.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nG\u00f6ttingen: Dieterich, 1835.\n2nd ed., 2 vols.

            "Dirk Nowitzki: German Wunderkind (stylized as DIRK NOWITZKI german wunderkind) is a biography of the German NBA basketball star Dirk Nowitzki, written by German sports journalists Dino Reisner and Holger Sauer. It was published in 2004 by the German \"Copress\" publishing house. It follows Nowitzki's life as a boy in W\u00fcrzburg, how he turned to basketball as a teenager, broke through in Germany and eventually became the franchise player of the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA.\n\n\n== Book synopsis ==\nIn this book, Reisner and Sauer follow the career of Dirk Nowitzki, beginning with his middle-class beginnings in W\u00fcrzburg. Originally interested in tennis and handball, the tall Nowitzki (who grew to become 7-foot-0) was drawn to basketball after being repeatedly taunted as a \"freak\" by his opponents. After being discovered by local basketball trainer J\u00fcrgen Meng, he met trainer Holger Geschwindner, who became his lifelong mentor and friend. Both discovered he had a natural talent for this sport and eventually became a star for the small local basketball club DJK W\u00fcrzburg.\nAfter attracting the attention of Dallas Mavericks head coach and manager Don Nelson, Nowitzki made the jump to the NBA and was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks, but was immediately traded to the Mavericks in the 1998 NBA draft. Shell-shocked by the culture shock, facing a longer season, more physical opponents, and a relatively foreign culture, he struggled in America, and even considered returning to Europe, until Nelson and Geschwindner talked him out of it. Becoming a regular player, a starter, and later an All-Star, the book presents the eventful playoff campaigns of the Mavericks until 2004. The book ends in the middle of the 2004\u201305 NBA season.\nThe book mostly follows a chronological structure, and devotes inserts for many people close to Nowitzki, such as his parents Helga and J\u00f6rg-Werner Nowitzki, who are both retired German professional handball players; his sister, Silke; his ex-girlfriend of seven years Sybille Gerer (former player of Nowitzki's former basketball club DJK W\u00fcrzburg), his discoverer J\u00fcrgen Meng, his mentors Geschwindner and Nelson, and his best friend Steve Nash. An extra section of the book is inserted at the end, which deals with his performances in the Germany national basketball team separately.\n\n\n== External links ==\nDirk Nowitzki: German Wunderkind record on WorldCat",

            "Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen (The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered) by Christian Konrad Sprengel was published in 1793, but received little acclaim during the author's lifetime. Sprengel's ideas were rejected by other naturalists when it was published, but the importance of this work was duly appreciated by Charles Darwin some sixty years later. Darwin's use of Sprengel's ideas and reference to this book in the seminal work on the Fertilisation of Orchids established Sprengel's book as one of the most important works in the fields of floral biology and pollination ecology and its author as a founding father of these fields.\nThe fact that flowers have a sexual role had been recognised earlier by Linnaeus who did not investigate any functional significance of the visits of insects, but by Sprengel's time it was known that they were sometimes involved in fertilisation. These were thought to be chance visits and nectar was not thought to be intended for insects. Sprengel's book introduced a functional view, which would today be called ecology, and provided evidence that pollination was an organised process in which insects acted as \"living brushes\" in a symbiotic relationship for the teleological purpose of fertilising the flowers. His discovery enabled him to understand the construction and arrangement of the parts of flowers, but he was puzzled by some features such as  the lack of nectar in orchids. He also investigated seed dispersal. His ideas went against prevailing dogma that flowers were generally self-fertilising and  that insect visits were rare, so his proposals were thought unnecessary. His ideas were also in conflict with belief in the created harmony of nature: in disagreeing with him, Goethe described nature as behaving like an artist, not a workman. Sprengel's discoveries were ignored and largely forgotten.\n\nDarwin's new evolutionary ideas rejected the idea that species characters were invariable. He was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, but as wild species usually remained homogenous, he thought that species were kept the same by natural cross-fertilisation. It would also give the evolutionary advantage that favourable changes were spread through a reproductive community, but this was contradicted by the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising. Sprengel's work suggested answers to this problem, and Darwin adopted Sprengel's methods in investigating various plants, particularly orchids.  He mentioned Sprengel in an 1841 letter to The Gardeners' Chronicle. and made reference to Sprengel's research in his unpublished 1844 Essay on the origin of species. A year later, Darwin wrote to his friend the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker about the need for insects to pollinate flowering plants; \"have you ever seen C. Sprengels curious book on this subject; I have verified many of his observations: doubtless he rides his theory very hard.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nVogel, Stefan (1996), Barrett, Spencer C.

The book sparked interest in the island among the Romantics, particularly in Germany, and introduced the world to the Blue Grotto, both as a tourist sight and as an iconic symbol for the island.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIn the book Kopisch describes how he met and became friends with local notary Don Giuseppe Pagano, who told him about the existence of a grotto that the locals presumably knew about but did not enter because of superstition. Swimming inside, he not only noticed the deeply saturated blue color of the water, but also found remains that suggested the grotto had been used by Romans in the past.\nAfter he had returned from the grotto, Kopisch made the first two sketches of it that started a wave of artistic and later photographic depictions of the Blue Grotto. On his second and third visits, Kopisch also made measurements of the grotto.\n\n\n== Bibliographic information ==\nAugust Kopisch; Dieter Richter (ed.) (1997).

            "The Hidden Face is a biography of Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux by the Catholic author Ida Friederike G\u00f6rres (1901 Bohemia  \u2013 1971 Germany). G\u00f6rres first published this book in German in 1944 as Das Verborgene Antlitz; in the eighth edition in German in 1958, it was renamed Das Senfkorn von Lisieux: Das verborgene Antlitz. Neue Deutung in German. An English version, translated by Richard and Clara Winston, was published in 1959; this was republished by Ignatius Press in 2003. The Hidden Face is considered to be G\u00f6rres's most important work.\nThe central question that prompted G\u00f6rres to write The Hidden Face was, \u201cWho was Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus in reality?\u201d The book contains seven chapters.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== I. The Question ===\n\u201cThe cult of Little Th\u00e9r\u00e8se has from the first been a mass movement.\" In the first chapter, G\u00f6rres explores the widespread fascination with St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se following her death in 1897. G\u00f6rres presents the paradox that St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se never \u201cdid anything that struck her contemporaries as extraordinary\u201d yet was the subject of an \u201cincredible storm of veneration.\"\n\n\n=== II. The Nest ===\nIn the second chapter, G\u00f6rres identifies and examines three stages in Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's childhood. Regarding the first stage of early childhood, G\u00f6rres notes that the saint's later doctrine of the \"way of spiritual childhood\" was based on the experience of an \"unmerited, unmeritable, anticipatory, unconditional and immutable\" love as a toddler. G\u00f6rres refers to the second part of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s childhood as the \u201csaddest time of her life\u201d lasting from age five to fourteen. The author asserts that the death of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s mother unlocked a \u201cdangerous, abnormal sensitivity\u201d in the child that plagued her during this period. The third and final stage of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's childhood was a time in which the young teenager \u201cregained her self\" and received \"the grace of complete conversion.\"\n\n\n=== III. The Desert ===\n\"It was the desert itself, not storms or dangerous beasts, that met her in the Carmel. She did not 'suffer from life', as do melancholics and those who are oversensitive; but she suffered life as simple and childlike folk must...suffered the permanence and inescapability of its demands, its irreconcilable contradictions, its stubborn disharmonies, its bleak destitution...\"G\u00f6rres summarizes Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's life in Carmel in this chapter, noting the trials faced by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in confronting strict treatment from the prioress and continued coddling from her family. The author also dedicates a section of the chapter to studying the puzzling personality of Mother Marie de Gonzague, who was prioress for many of Therese's years in the convent.\n\n\n=== IV. The Way ===\nG\u00f6rres highlights Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's complete obedience in Carmel, particularly in the form of \"complete and pure submission to the authority of God as represented by her appointed superiors.\" G\u00f6rres claims that the saint practiced love of neighbor \"for almost her entire life...solely out of obedience\" through intentional acts such as sitting beside difficult sisters during the recreation hour. After exploring Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's love for Scripture, G\u00f6rres briefly examines Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's religious titles of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face, stating that they \"imply a consecration and an imitation,\" respectively.\n\n\n=== V. The Breakthrough ===\n\nIn the beginning of this chapter, G\u00f6rres expands on Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's oblation as a voluntary victim to the divine mercy of God. The author also considers Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's vocation of love, which manifested itself through loving and suffering for souls. G\u00f6rres dedicates a section to analyzing the meaning of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's smile and outward reserve, subsequently discussing her role as novice mistress. In the final part of the chapter, G\u00f6rres outlines and elaborates on Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's famous \"Little Way.\"\n\n\n=== VI. Perfection ===\nG\u00f6rres asserts that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's way would have remained hidden if not for the tuberculosis that caused her death at age twenty-four. While describing the effects of the fatal disease over time, G\u00f6rres explores the mystery of suffering in the context of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's experience. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's spiritual struggle with uncertainty about personal immortality is also discussed in this section.\n\n\n=== VII. The Riddle of Glory ===\nIn the quiet life of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se there was revived the ancient, original, Gospel concept of sanctity, of the baptized Christian whose whole life reflects Christ in all its elements, who is saintly not because he does or says special things which set him off from others, but because he is a tiny member of Christ present in the world and because he endeavors to walk worthily in the path of his vocation.G\u00f6rres admits that human efforts played a significant role in the origination and propagation of the devotion to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, but she also credits divine providence and confirmation as vital to the flourishing of the movement. In this chapter, G\u00f6rres also claims that the particular circumstances of the saint's life allowed Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to express a message that represents a hidden and widespread number of faithful members of the Church from throughout the centuries.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 1990, psychologist Fr. Benedict Groeschel, C.F.R., praised the book not only as an account of St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se but, in addition, he wrote, \u201cOne of the most outstanding biographies of a saint ever written is The Hidden Face, the life of Th\u00e9r\u00e9se of Lisieux, by Ida F. Goerres.\"\nAnd at the time the English translation of The Hidden Face was released in 1959, there were many positive reviews in the UK and the USA. For example:\n\nIn the assessment of reviewer Paul R. Rust, The Hidden Face is \u201cunquestionably the finest contribution yet to the voluminous writings on the Little Flower.\u201d\nIn the Catholic magazine The Lamp, a reviewer identified The Hidden Face as among the \u201cbooks which help toward increasing our knowledge of Christ.\u201dThe prominent English Roman Catholic priest Cyril Charlie Martindale noted that the writing of the book \u201cadded, most valuably, to the mountain of books piled above St. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux.\u201d\nAccording to a review by S.M. Albert, the book \u201cis original, profound, stimulating, and one can scarcely imagine its being bettered as a serious biographical study.\u201d\nIn the Catholic publication Dominicana, a reviewer referred to The Hidden Face as \u201ca powerfully convincing book\u201d and \u201can untouched portrait of a great saint, removed from all the savors of poor hagiography and pious sentimentality.\"\nRegarding The Hidden Face, reviewer Luke Rigby, O.S.B., \u201cfelt more sure that nobody has expressed more honestly, clearly and lovingly the essential significance and attraction of this saint.\u201d\nIn the Jesuit periodical Woodstock Letters, Gerard Giblin called the book \u201cone of the most comprehensive to appear to date,\u201d adding that it would \u201cbe many years before it is replaced.\u201d \nReviewer Sister Mary William called the book \u201ca very satisfying experience\u201d and that in the book \u201cTherese\u2019s life and character are examined objectively\u201d more than any other book she had read.\nAmerican theologian Donald Bloesch asserted that G\u00f6rres \u201cgives an acute psychological and profound theological appraisal of the life and message of St. Therese in her book The Hidden Face.\u201d\n\n\n== Translations ==\nThe Hidden Face has also been translated from German also into Dutch, Indonesian, Japanese, and Portuguese:\n\nDutch: Het Verborgen Gelaat: Schets Tot Een Levensbeeld van Th\u00e9r\u00e8se van Lisieux.

            "Historia animalium (\"History of the Animals\"), published in Zurich in 1551\u20131558 and 1587, is an encyclopedic \"inventory of renaissance zoology\" by Conrad Gessner (1516\u20131565). Gessner was a medical doctor and professor at the Carolinum in Z\u00fcrich, the precursor of the University of Zurich. The Historia animalium, after Aristotle's work of the same name, is the first modern zoological work that attempts to describe all the animals known, and the first bibliography of natural history writings. The five volumes of natural history of animals cover more than 4500 pages. The animals are presented in alphabetical order, marking the change from Middle Ages encyclopedias, or \"mirrors\" to a modern view of a consultation work.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Historia animalium was Gessner's magnum opus, and was the most widely read of all the Renaissance natural histories. The generously illustrated work was so popular that Gessner's abridgement, Thierbuch (\"Animal Book\"), was published in Zurich in 1563, and in England Edward Topsell translated and condensed it as a Historie of foure-footed beastes (London: William Jaggard, 1607). Gessner's monumental work attempts to build a connection between the ancient knowledge of the animal world, its title the same as Aristotle's work on animals, and what was known at his time. He then adds his own observations, and those of his correspondents, in an attempt to formulate a comprehensive description of the natural history of animals.\nGessner's Historia animalium is based on classical sources. It is compiled from ancient and medieval texts, including the inherited knowledge of ancient naturalists like Aristotle, Pliny the Elder, and Aelian. Gessner was known as \"the Swiss Pliny.\" For information he relied heavily on the Physiologus.\nIn his larger works Gessner sought to distinguish fact from myth and popular misconceptions, and so his encyclopedic work included both extinct creatures and newly discovered animals of the East Indies, those of the far north and animals brought back from the New World.  The work included extensive information on mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles. It described in detail their daily habits and movements. It also included their uses in medicine and nutrition.\nHistoria animalium showed the animals' places in history, literature and art. Sections of each chapter detailed the animal and its attributes, in the tradition of the emblem book. Gessner's work included facts in different languages such as the names of the animals.\n\n\n== Fantastical creatures ==\n\nThere have been various academic studies relating to Gessner's inclusion of fantastical creatures in the volumes, such as the sea monk, sea bishop, or ichthyocentaur.\nGessner was aware of fakery in the curio shops market, where dried rays were manipulated to look like dragons (for example Jenny Hanivers). There may have also been fake mermaid-like creatures being imported from China by the Dutch.\nAlso, commercial interests may also have motivated publishers or authors such as Gessner to include such creatures to boost sales. But Gessner was known for meticulously checking facts, and it has been suggested that publishers may have interpolated material when Gessner was in no condition to gainsay them, since the author was already morbidly ill by the time of these publications. In fact there is the example of the Su of Patagonia, posthumously inserted in the 1603 Frankfurt edition.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nVolume 1: Live-bearing four-footed animals (viviparous quadrupeds) (1551).\nVolume 2: Egg-laying (oviparous) quadrupeds (reptiles and amphibia) (1554).\nVolume 3: Birds (1555).\nVolume 4: Fish and aquatic animals (1558).\nVolume 5: Snakes and scorpions (incomplete, published posthumously 1587).\n\n\n== Illustrations ==\n\nThe colored woodcut illustrations were the first real attempts to represent animals in their natural environment. It is the first book to illustrate fossils.\nGessner acknowledges one of his main illustrators was Lucas Schan, an artist from Strasbourg. He likely used other illustrators as well as himself; the book is however famous for copying illustrations from other sources, including Durer's Rhinoceros from a well-known 1515 woodcut. Gessner's natural history was unusual for sixteenth century readers in providing illustrations.\n\n\n== Censorship ==\nThere was extreme religious tension at the time Historia animalium came out. Under Pope Paul IV it was felt that the religious convictions of an author contaminated all his writings, and as Gessner was a Protestant, it was added to the Catholic Church's list of prohibited books.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nConradi Gesneri Medici Tigurini Historiae Animalium liber primus.

            "Historia von D. Johann Fausten, the first \"Faust book\", is a chapbook of stories concerning the life of Johann Georg Faust, written by an anonymous German author. It was published by Johann Spies (1540\u20131623) in Frankfurt am Main in 1587, and became the main source for the play The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe and Goethe's closet play Faust, and also served as the libretto of the opera by Alfred Schnittke, also entitled Historia von D. Johann Fausten.\nThe Faust Book seems to have been written during the latter half of the sixteenth century (1568\u201381 or shortly thereafter).  It comes down to us in manuscript from a professional scribe in Nuremberg and also as a 1587 imprint from the prominent Frankfurt publishing house of Johann Spies.\nThe better-known version is the Spies imprint of 1587.  It came out in September, was reprinted again in the same year and very frequently thereafter, each time with additional tales about Faust, usually old, known folktales with the superimposition of Faust's name.  In accord with the theological reputation and clientele of the Spies printing house, their 1587 imprint is also heavily larded with religious commentary.  Such \"admonitions to the Christian reader\" played so well that by the end of the century they had grown to become the major part of the (printed) Faust Books.  The general sloppiness and repetitiveness of all these additions, however, seems to have diminished the book's popularity in the long run.  As people became less disposed to religious controversy it ceased to be such an attractive book.\nAn English version based on the Historia was published in 1592, which became known as the \"English Faust Book\". The Historia may also have been the source of Thomas Roscoe's translation, \"History of that Renowned Arch Sorcerer, Doctor J. Faust\", published in The German Novelists (1826).\nThe manuscript version of the Historia was eventually edited by H. G. Haile for the Erich Schmidt Verlag, 1960, and for Carl Winter Verlag, 1996. Haile also published a translation, The History of Dr. Johann Faustus (University of Illinois, 1965).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Wolfenb\u00fcttel Manuscript, in German\nFaust Legends\nFaust Legends\n\"History of that Renowned Arch Sorcerer, Doctor J.

            "In the Shadow of Your Wings (Unter dem Schatten deiner Fl\u00fcgel) is a collection of selected entries from the diary of Jochen Klepper covering the period between April 1932 and 10 December 1942. The book appeared in 1956.\nThe Protestant German writer, journalist and poet of ecclesiastical songs, Jochen Klepper, loses his creative power in the course of the above-mentioned ten years under steadily increasing National Socialist reprisals. Klepper is married with the Jew Johanna. Hanni, as Johanna is called, has brought two daughters from her first marriage. Klepper's younger stepdaughter Renate is threatened with deportation after the war begins.  Klepper applies for an exit permit for the young girl to go to Sweden. The author appeals to the security services. There his request is turned down. Klepper takes his own life together along the lives of his wife and child in a nondescript Berlin residential house.\n\n\n== Diary ==\n1932 Klepper suffers from his childlessness. He calls himself a \"religious socialist\". The work of the 30-year-old author is narrow. But Klepper is fulfilled as an intellectual by big desire for fame.\n1933 To Kleppers understanding is not author who has merely ideas and materials. Author is who can express that quite peculiar \"state of the liveliness\" in his text. Talent would be unnecessary.\nThe Nazis have now all power monopolized. Klepper is at the Radio employed. He is denounced: \"Jewish family. SPD member\" is the accusation. The active employees will be suspended from service. Still Klepper not despondent. Because he holds fast to his faith, writes in his novel \"The Father, Novel of the Soldier-King\" (Stuttgart 1937) and loves his wife Hanni. Is Klepper \"divine tool\"? He has doubts.\nAlso  these odious \"memoirs\", which Klepper writes down - which value do they have? The writer will remain in the country at any rate. Abroad he sees no working possibility. Indeed, in Berlin the giants Ullstein and Ufa want his cooperation, however, do not pay. Thus Klepper would like to be taken up in the Empire Literature Chamber.\n1934 The plan succeeds, because one of his guarantors is a SA man. Besides, Klepper calls the National Socialists \"ill visionaries\", if he entrusts with his worry about the future of Germany the diary.\n1935 Clamour is not possible for Klepper. He lives under the motto \"Keep still\". With such behavior a small private sphere can be saved. The excesses in Kurf\u00fcrstendamm are disconcerting. Jewish women receive on the open road slaps in the face. In spite of all that, Klepper further wants to write, as long as he may still remain in the Empire Literature Chamber. Since writing is a religious process for him. God has called the author and latter answers with a book - a stammered answer.\n1936 German relatives recommend to the couple Klepper repeatedly to send both daughters in the sure foreign country. Klepper said the precaution would be unnecessary. The author probably knows about his isolation in Germany, however, he builds on the help of God.\nIn 1937, on 25 March the author from the Empire Literature Chamber is excluded. The reason is to Kleppers conviction his mixing marriage. The exclusion is out on an appeal in June suspended, and the Imperial War Department recommends Kleppers new novel \"The Father\" as a reading for the Wehrmacht members.\n1938 However, the Empire Literature Chamber accuses the Christian Klepper \"of slavish posture\" which would contradict the \"new mind\". From March Klepper is supervised no more by the Empire Literature Chamber, but by the Propaganda Ministry. Nevertheless, in this precarious situation there is still a courageous journalist, the Klepper his organ as a platform offers: The Protestant theologian Prof. Mulert encourages the author to write for the \"Christian world\". Klepper remains careful. If Ernst Wiechert sits, nevertheless, because of the case Niem\u00f6ller in the concentration camp. Klepper and his wife, Hanni register well as Jewish doctors and lawyers in Germany are no longer allowed to practice, how German Jews to sell their assets and emigrate. There should be a concentration camp near Weimar. Every German Jew should carry from 1 January 1939, in addition, the given name Israel or Sara and must give him everywhere. Polish Jews in Germany will be imprisoned or expelled. In spite of this news couple Klepper builds a new house in Berlin. In connection with the Kristallnacht Klepper disturb the arbitrary arrests of Jewish men by the Gestapo. Klepper's wife Hanni converts to the Christianity. Klepper is horrified about Hannis identification card.\n1939 Both stepdaughters Kleppers would like to emigrate. Wife Hanni wants to remain. NS ideologist Rosenberg speaks openly, all Jews should leave the German Reich. German Jews must offer before certain valuables - as for example precious metals - to buying places to the sales.\nWhen the war breaks out, Klepper does a patriotic note in his diary: He could not Germany the decline wish. As from November Jews for leaving their local authorized by the Gestapo need, Klepper expresses the suicide thought. Is suicide a sin? The older stepdaughter is the departure to England succeed. Because of the younger daughter Renate wants the couple to stay alive.\n1940 February: A rumour reaches Klepper. Jews would be deported by Szczecin to Lublin. As a wife of an \"Aryan\" Hanni is protected. However, for daughter Renate it becomes more and more dangerous: Men of the Death's Head SS ring in the front door and inquire after the young girl. Renate converts - like before her mother - to the Christianity. Klepper receives news from an unfathomable process in the German Reich: Hindered are murdered. All called events weaken taken together the creativity of the sensitive Klepper so much that he manages the next novels (Katharina von Bora) no more. The vitality, however, he wants to keep. And thus he struggles dogged, tenaciously and, in the end, successfully for an entry permit for Renate to Sweden. For all that Klepper means on 26 July surprisingly, Germany will defeat England.\n1941 From December, 1940 Klepper serves with the armed forces and will dismiss at the beginning of October, 1941 because of \"military unworthiness\", thus because of his \"non-aryan marriage\". Berlin's Jews are now in a very hard situation. Renate must carry discriminating Yellow badge and brings terrifying news with home: Confessed become after Litzmannstadt deports. The suicide thought lies to young Renate far. She hopes for survival. Klepper penetrates up to \"Imperial Minister Dr. Frick\" and obtains a document in which Renate ministerial protection from deportation is assured. This letter may Renates life admittedly only so long protected until the Sicherheitsdienst mercilessly intervenes. News about the deportation of Jews takes no end. Renate sways between depression and hope.\nThe girl tells the thoughts of suicide, if their departure fail should, not go back. News of massacres, perpetrated on Jews, invade from the east to Berlin.\n1942 Hanni rejects the thought of triple suicide. Klepper does not know whether he should condemn the German warfare. After tantalizing back-and-forth Renate from Sweden receives the desired entry permit. Frick is no more responsible, in the meantime, for the exit permit, but now Eichmann. Klepper does not receive the permission and goes voluntarily to the death.\n\n\n== Persons ==\nKlepper reports about narrower contacts with writers: Reinhold Schneider and Rudolf Alexander Schr\u00f6der are called multiple. Klepper mentions several prominent concentration camp prisoners - activists of the Bekennenden Kirche - thus, e.g., the pastor Ehrenberg-Bochum.\n\n\n== Style and themes ==\nThe extensive memoirs can be read as a dialog with God. Klepper lays his welfare and woe in the hands of the Lord. However, besides, Klepper knows that he \"one day\", as Bergengruen formulates a little disrespectfully, before \"his heavenly commander\" will have to be responsible for his acting and letting. The form arises from the said. Klepper, deeply religious, has torn to and fro. He knows, he does mistakes, but he cannot from his skin. Among the wings of the Lord standing, the fate of the author's resume. And Klepper meticulously describes the process. The honesty and independence of the author is impressive with all. Before the surprised reader enters less the fighter Klepper than rather the silent sufferer.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBergengruen does in January 1957 in his detailed review to the first publication of the diaries no secret from his quite obviously deeply to seated resentments.\nIt looks as subordinate Bergengruen of sister Hildegard  of the author material motives in the publication of the diaries of brother.\nBergengruen speaks a truth. Renate's life was as of a \"full Jew\" - as one said in the NS linguistic usage - threatens in the German Reich. Klepper has had long enough time to support the emigration of the girl. Bergengruen can conclude in the connection from the memoirs neither on feelings of guilt nor on selfdoubt of the author.\nTo an opponent of the Nazi regime the subservient Klepper could not explain itself.\nIndeed, Bergengruen certifies mental power to the author, however, it lacks him of feeling and imagination.\nBergengruen also calls details which are not discoverable in the available book: For example, when he Klepper after October 1941, in his Berlin home visits, the blended man of the house has glorified his period of service with the armed forces and has regretted his forcible elimination from the troop.\nKlepper should have taken away his diaries from the access of the NS henchmen successfully, while he buried the papers.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSource\nJochen Klepper: Unter dem Schatten deiner Fl\u00fcgel.

            "Kanaan\u00e4ische und Aram\u00e4ische Inschriften (in English, Canaanite and Aramaic Inscriptions), or KAI, is the standard source for the original text of Canaanite and Aramaic inscriptions not contained in the Hebrew Bible.\nIt was first published from 1960 to 1964 in three volumes by the German orientalists Herbert Donner and Wolfgang R\u00f6llig, and has been updated in numerous subsequent editions.\nThe work attempted to \"integrate philology, palaeography and cultural history\" in the commented re-editing of a selection of Canaanite and Aramaic Inscriptions, using the \"pertinent source material for the Phoenician, Punic, Moabite, pre-exile-Hebrew and Ancient Aramaic cultures.\" R\u00f6llig and Donner had the support of William F. Albright in Baltimore, James Germain F\u00e9vrier in Paris and Giorgio Levi Della Vida in Rome during the compilation of the first edition.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nThe 4th edition was published between 1966 and 1969, and a 5th edition was published in 2002. However, the 5th edition only comprised the first volume (showing the texts in modern Hebrew script), expanding the previous edition by 40 texts. An updated version of the third volume (a brief bibliography of all the texts in Volume 1) was proposed.\nThe first edition was intended to represent all the known texts of significant importance, but not to be a complete collection to replace the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum. With respect to Aramaic inscriptions, all stone inscriptions until the Achaemenid Empire were included, whereas Imperial Aramaic inscriptions are only partially represented. Less emphasis was put on Aramaic papyri, ostraca and clay tablets, as such collections either already existed or were being prepared elsewhere. The included papyri and ostraca were chosen in order to provide and objective rounding of the picture, such as if they were published in a remote location. Nabataean and Palmyrene inscriptions were excluded, as were most of the Elephantine papyri.\nThe inscriptions were ordered geographically, and then chronologically within each geography; a division was made between \u201cPunic\u201d and \u201cNeo Punic\u201d that was acknowledged to be subjective.\nIn the second edition, four new texts were added - the fourth of the Karatepe inscriptions (KAI 26), and the three new texts (KAI 277-279). In the fifth edition, 40 new texts were added, primarily because they were only discovered or published after the appearance of the original edition or - like the Agrigentum inscription (KAI 302) - were given a new relevance due to a recent interpretation.\nTwo groups of new texts were not included in the fifth edition: new Hebrew inscriptions, which were considered to have been well summarized in J. Renz / W.

            "The Kangaroo Chronicles is a book series by the German author, singer-songwriter and Kabarett artist Marc-Uwe Kling. The first book in the series, Die K\u00e4nguru-Chroniken (en: The Kangaroo Chronicles), was published in 2009. The second volume, Das K\u00e4nguru-Manifest (en: The Kangaroo Manifesto), was published in 2011; the third volume followed in 2014 under the name Die K\u00e4nguru-Offenbarung (en: The Kangaroo Revelations). The fourth volume is called Die K\u00e4nguru-Apokryphen (en: The Kangaroo Apocrypha) and was published in 2018. In 2020, a film of the same name was released by ZDF and X Filme.\nThe stories in the anthology were originally broadcast as a weekly podcast, Neues vom K\u00e4nguru (en: News from the Kangaroo), on Fritz, a Berlin-based radio station. In 2010, the podcast was awarded the German Radio Prize for \"Best Comedy\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Die K\u00e4nguru Chroniken (The Kangaroo Chronicles) ===\nThe story opens with Marc-Uwe Kling answering the door to a kangaroo. It explains that it would like to borrow some eggs from him, as it wants to make pancakes but did not remember to buy any eggs. The author is flabbergasted by the talking animal but reacts quickly and fetches some eggs for his new neighbor. Shortly after he had closed the door, it rings again \u2013 the Kangaroo also needs to borrow some salt, milk, flour, oil and a pan. Marc-Uwe is happy to help out, grabs the ingredients and the pan and gives them to the Kangaroo. Before he's even moved an inch from the door, the bell rings once again. The Kangaroo does not have a stove yet. Marc-Uwe invites his neighbor into the kitchen \u2013 a momentous decision, considering the Kangaroo later moves in with him, without asking for permission, and the two of them become flatmates.\nThe Kangaroo refuses to pursue stable employment, and when asked about it, simply states \"I'm a Communist. Got something against it?\" As such, the author is responsible for the Kangaroo's livelihood. The Chronicles report their conversations and shared experiences, usually through direct speech. Each chapter is a complete short story in and of itself, but they do build on top of one another. For instance, in one story, the author pulls a book out of a fuzzy sock, referring to an earlier chapter when he mentioned that he keeps his books inside fuzzy socks to keep them from sliding off his crooked shelf. These connecting elements, referring to punch lines from earlier stories and requiring knowledge of previous events appear as running gags throughout the books.\nThe story is set in Berlin, and occasionally mentions concrete geographical locations, such as Berlin-Kreuzberg or the underground station Kottbusser Tor.\nThe relationship between Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo is characterized by bickering, jealousy and spending a lot of time with each other \u2013 a bit like a stereotypical marriage. Their topics of conversation range from media and linguistic criticism to capitalism, questions of life and faith, contemporary protest culture, Karl Marx, Bertolt Brecht, the Red Army Faction and the Viet Cong.\nTowards the end of the book the two are confronted with a new neighbor \u2013 the Penguin. It introduces itself as a salesman for frozen food, but both Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo are immediately suspicious of it.\n\n\n=== Das K\u00e4nguru Manifest (The Kangaroo Manifesto) ===\nThe second volume ties in where the first one ends. The reader learns about the fictional Ministerium f\u00fcr Produktivit\u00e4t (en: Ministry of Productivity), which plans to crack down on unemployed persons by introducing the Initiative f\u00fcr mehr Arbeit (en: Initiative for More Labour). Meanwhile, a rivalry develops between the Kangaroo and the Penguin. The Kangaroo, for instance, installs its punching bag so it bumps into their shared wall whenever it's punched. In return, the Penguin places several alarm clocks against the wall in order to wake the Kangaroo. Marc-Uwe's editor suggests to the Kangaroo that the Penguin is its archenemy, fighting to advance its kapitalistischen Weltverschlechterungsplan (en: Capitalist plot to screw up the world). At an awards ceremony which Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo attend as were nominees for the \"Best Book Featuring a Talking Animal,\" they meet J\u00f6rg and J\u00f6rn Dwigs \u2013 brothers who founded the right-wing populist party Sicherheit und Verantwortung (en: Safety and Responsibility). This inspires the Kangaroo to found das Asoziale Netzwerk (en: the anti-social network) \u2013 a group that commits \"anti-terror attacks\" aimed at \"The System.\" The SV is elected to parliament in the next elections and plans to categorise foreigners into two groups: productive or unproductive. The Ministry of Productivity implements this plan, despite the efforts of the Anti-Social Network to destroy its databases. At the close of the book, the Kangaroo, who still believes the Penguin to be the head of the campaign, is categorised as unproductive and is deported.\nAlthough each short story remains intelligible on its own, in the second volume, Kling begins to develop an overarching plot line\u2014whereas the first volume primarily revolves around realist depictions of everyday life in Berlin (with the exception of the talking kangaroo), the second volume introduces various fictional, quasi-realistic organisations and institutions.\n\n\n=== Die K\u00e4nguru-Offenbarung (The Kangaroo Revelations) ===\nThe third volume is divided into two parts \u2013 Revelations I and II.\nAt the beginning of Revelations I, Marc-Uwe has been alone for several months already and is suffering from depression. However, the Kangaroo soon returns. Since it is now an illegal immigrant, it relies on a series of disguises to avoid deportation. The two quickly determine that the Penguin no longer lives in his flat, so they make it their mission to find him. They do not follow a set plan or strategy, preferring simply to look in many different places\u2014but wherever they end up, they seem to have just missed the penguin. At the end of part 1, Marc-Uwe's editor asks for more grandeur, so in Revelations II, the flatmates carry on their search abroad.\nMarc-Uwe and the Kangaroo visit New York City, Toronto, Brussels, Seattle and Caracas, then Toronto again, and finally Ho-Chi-Minh City. It turns out that the Anti-Social Network has branched out into regional groups all over the world, and they encounter other members in New York and Toronto. In Ho-Chi-Minh City, Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo find a factory that is run by the Penguin. To find out what is being manufactured there, they follow the supply chain, eventually reaching an island in the Aegean Sea. The Kangaroo develops the theory that the Penguin and his associates want to turn the whole world into an airport. Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo find the penguins' headquarters, where it turns out they're raising small penguins. Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo barely escape the penguins' factory, only making it out with the help of a turncoat penguin. Finally, they make their way to the Outback, where they meet an independent group of kangaroos who are also fighting against \"The System\" and the penguins.\nThe Revelations also include an appendix which describes various anti-terror attacks against the Kangaroo's various foes. The final part of this appendix describes the kangaroos' sabotage of the penguins' first airport.\nRevelations I is similar to the Manifesto in that its stories remain comprehensible in isolation; the stories in the second part, on the other hand, build upon one another. As the book progresses, its chapters become less and less individually comprehensible. The Revelations incorporate many elements characteristic of Fantasy novels. It also contains various running gags new to the series. For example, every time the protagonists meet someone abroad, it's emphasised again and again what a crazy coincidence it is that the new character just happens to speak German.\n\n\n=== Die K\u00e4nguru-Apokryphen (The Kangaroo Apocrypha) ===\nThe fourth volume was published in October 2018. It is made up of 30 different stories, by and large not organised in chronological order. Nevertheless, some series of interdependent stories, for example those featuring Dietmar K\u00f6tke, are told chronologically. Some of the stories are set during the time period of the Chronicles, but others occur even after the end of the Revelations. The Apocrypha also include some stories from earlier volumes, retold from the perspective of the Kangaroo.\n\n\n== Characters and organisations ==\n\n\n=== Protagonists ===\n\n\n==== Narrator ====\nThe protagonist of the Chronicles is the first-person narrator, Marc-Uwe. He is characterized as an educated, critical, self-reflecting intellectual in his late twenties. Marc-Uwe is a member of the 'Kleinkunstszene' of Berlin (genre of arts including poetry slam, kabarett, and comedy amongst other things). He was born in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and now lives in a flat in Berlin. Money is usually tight, this does not change when the Kangaroo moves in, as it does not make any money and has Marc-Uwe pay for everything. Marc-Uwe likes to read his poems to the Kangaroo and tell it about his thoughts, plans and ideas, which the Kangaroo likes to criticize ruthlessly. It is not often that the two are on a par in their debates and discussions, however, the Kangaroo tends to win most discussions as it uses unfair and malicious techniques when debating.\n\n\n==== The Kangaroo ====\nThe Kangaroo fought in the Vietnam War on the side of the Viet Cong, according to its statement, and came to the GDR as Vertragsarbeiter (contract worker) with his mother after the war had ended. However, later, it is discovered that it only waved at the last American helicopter as a little baby out of its mother's pouch. It tells the narrator that it's a full-time communist, but files for unemployment later in the text. It is a relentless critic of capitalism and fights for a just world order, bread for all and the ban of the so-called music television (television where music, music videos and information related to music is aired), which is why it founded the \"Judeo-Bolshevist world conspiracy association\" (original: \"J\u00fcdisch-Bolschewistische Weltverschw\u00f6rung e.V.\"). But all of these attempts fail naturally because of the insignificance of the Kangaroo in the world's affairs and because of its laziness. Thereby, its critical of capitalism attitude is often counteracted because it's kept by the narrator. In addition to that, it uses the narrator as object for its unfair trade practices (such as forced ringtone subscriptions).\nThe kangaroo loves booze pralines, schnitzel buns with mince, as well as the band Nirvana and movies with Bud Spencer \u2013 preferably without Terence Hill. It is literate, argues radical and consequent, while simultaneously behaving childish, defiant and goatish. It does steal ashtrays whenever it has the opportunity and is occasionally malicious and back-stabbing. In dicey situations though, the kangaroo selflessly assists his roommate. It always carries a ton of stuff in his pouch. Until the kangaroo locates what it precisely needs, it frequently has to search for long time and then pulls out books, bolt cutters, newspapers, stolen ashtrays and lots more. In many cases the red boxing gloves it carries in his pouch come to use, which most of the times are found unerringly.\nIt is working on a magnum opus, which, according to the Kangaroo, carries the two human main driving forces in its title: \"opportunism and repression\". The Kangaroo tends to cite smaller passages out of it.\nAs a fictive character the Kangaroo \u2013 even though the author repeatedly mentions the Kangaroo's existence \u2013 functions as the author's alter ego, as a being which isn't bound to the common norms of the society. Therefore, it can say and do whatever it wants and what the author would be prohibited from doing. In literature this a known and frequently used stylistic device. It is possible for the Kangaroo to insult officers or kick small dogs out of the way, while naturally discussing their particular aerodynamic characteristics. At a cocktail party, it pees on J\u00f6rn Dwigs, the founder of a fictitious right-wing populist party because it decided to take figures of speech literally. The comedy of the Chronicles results from these liberties the Kangaroo takes. Furthermore, the Kangaroo is able to voice unconventional truths, similar to the child in the fairy tale \"The Emperor's New Clothes\". The Kangaroo is often childish and cunning, sometimes mischievous, but is in the end willing to reconcile with the author, most gladly however after winning an argument.\nThe Kangaroo has features, which can be interpreted as typically female as well as typically male. That's why the Kangaroo's gender is not clearly definable. Although only female kangaroos have a permanent pouch - and the Kangaroo uses its pouch clich\u00e9dly as a kind of chaotic handbag in the course of the three books - it suggests that the pouch might be just stapled on in the course of book three. In an interview the author said that the Kangaroo was \"bi-trans-metro-sexual\".\n\n\n=== The main character's friends ===\n\n\n==== Axel Krapotke ====\nKrapotke is a somewhat silly young Bundeswehr soldier who appears for the first time in the second part and later joins the Anti-Social Network. He is often excluded from the rest of the group and not rarely brings the Kangaroo to spectacular outbursts of rage, for example because he thinks the rules for Mau Mau are too complicated.\n\n\n==== Friedrich-Wilhelm and Otto-Von ====\nFriedrich-Wilhelm and Otto-Von are two brothers of Turkish descent whose parents, according to Friedrich-Wilhelm, \"went a little over the top with their intention to integrate\". They are part of the Anti-Social Network founded by the Kangaroo and play a key role in it alongside the Kangaroo and the narrator. Out of the two brothers, Friedrich-Wilhelm features more often in the stories; he studies medicine and finds a girlfriend between the second and third book. They have a son named Bartholom\u00e4us. Otto-Von appears mainly in the second book. He runs a small shop called \"Snacks and the City\", where he initially sells doner kebap and fruit. Later, after a business idea of Otto-Von, he sells solely cheap beer. During the course of the book, his business expands and becomes a chain store.\n\n\n==== God ====\nGod is a female member of the Anti-Social Network, which was founded by the Kangaroo. Her true name Maria is first mentioned in the chapter \"Swedish Scientists\" of the Kangaroo Apocrypha, as well as the fact that she successfully completed her study of arts. However, her code name in the network is often used for a running gag (this is how the characters talk about God, using phrases that can be related to both her and the religious figure). During the plot, the protagonist falls in love with her and is therefore often nervous and stammering in her presence. God herself doesn't seem to have any special interest in him. As mentioned during the plot, God lives in a council flat and has a little son named Jesus with her boyfriend, who owns a mobile phone shop. Another running gag is God's frequent changes of profession, which all show precarious employment (\"I collect shitty jobs like other people collect surprise egg figures!\").\n\n\n==== Herta ====\nHerta is the owner of the narrator's local pub. She is apparently a former East Berlin native, as she e.g. disadvantages West Germans at her pub toilet; moreover, she speaks with a strong Berlin dialect. After she has to close her pub in the second book because a resident complains about the noise, she opens an illegal pub, mainly frequented by members of the Anti-Social Network and Spanish tourists. Herta is also part of the Anti-Social Network and has the nickname \"Amazonenk\u00f6nigin\" (en: \"Queen of the Amazons\"). Her motto is: \"Es jibt sone und solche, un' dann jibt's noch janz andre, aber det sind die Schlimmsten\" (en: \"There are such people and others, and then there are totally different ones, but those are the worst\").\n\n\n==== Sarah ====\nSarah is a young backpacker, who meets Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo several times on their trip around the world. Sarah is an extremely hyperactive person, who talks quickly in streams of words. She likes to use English words like \"amazing\" and \"awesome\", as well as phrases such as \"It's kind of like...\" and \"You know...\" on a frequent basis. This phenomenon is said to occur due to the pills prescribed by her psychiatrist (this is a reference to a previously stated gag between the protagonist and his psychiatrist, who wants to prescribe Marc-Uwe mood lifters). During the plot, she develops a romantic interest in Marc-Uwe, which he does not return. Later in the story, it turns out that Sarah is actually from Germany, too, after which conversations between her and Marc-Uwe are held in German and not in English anymore.\n\n\n=== Antagonists ===\n\n\n==== The Penguin ====\nAt the End of Chronicles, the Penguin moves into the flat opposite of the one Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo share. Shortly after that, the Penguin is proclaimed the \"cosmic antagonist\" by the Kangaroo. From Manifesto onwards, the Kangaroo and the Penguin aim to terrorise each other, amongst other things by loud noise. In Revelations, Marc-Uwe and the Kangaroo chase the Penguin around the world to prevent its \"Kapitalistischen Weltverschlechterungsplan\" (en: capitalist plan in order to screw up the world). As it turns out, there is not only one Penguin, but thousands. Their leader is a large emperor penguin.\n\n\n==== J\u00f6rg and J\u00f6rn Dwigs ====\nJ\u00f6rn and J\u00f6rg Dwigs are twins. They first appear in Manifesto. J\u00f6rg is a judge for asylum law who became famous because of his 100% rejection quote. J\u00f6rn is a bank director and finances the populistic right-wing party Sicherheit und Verantwortung (SV) (meaning \"security and responsibility\"), which the two of them founded. He is the author of a book called \"Ich bin ja kein Rassist, aber\" (\"Well, I\u00b4m not a racist, but\"). J\u00f6rg Dwigs is an allusion to the Austrian right-wing populist J\u00f6rg Haider who was the chairman of the Austrian party FP\u00d6 for many years.\n\n\n==== Schmidtchen ====\nSchmidtchen is a policeman who would like to arrest the Kangaroo, but his intellect is inferior to its rhetoric talent. He forgets his valid suspicions about the Kangaroo as soon as he enters the apartment and gets involved in a discussion with it, where it uses confusing arguments. He only appears in the Chronicles on two occasions.\n\n\n=== Other characters and organizations ===\n\n\n==== The Anti-Social Network ====\nThe Anti-Social Network is an \"anti-terror-organization\" that was founded by the Kangaroo. It works against the \"terror of media, government and economy\". The name was chosen because all systems that call themselves social are anti-social, according to the Kangaroo. Therefore, a truly social organization has to call itself anti-social. On the basis of the real structure of such organizations, every member and every gathering can give itself a senseless title, there are no hierarchies. The actions that the network carries out, the so-called anti-terror-attacks, can be named however the perpetrator wants to call them accordingly.\n\n\n==== The psychiatrist ====\nSince the very first volume, the narrator keeps appointments with his psychiatrist regularly and tells him about his adventures with the Kangaroo. The psychiatrist interprets the existence of the Kangaroo as a hallucination of the narrator until he brings the Kangaroo to an appointment. On the strength of that, the psychiatrist has a nervous breakdown, undergoes medical treatment himself, represses the existence of the Kangaroo and keeps trying to convince the I-narrator of its nonexistence. The fact that the psychiatrist rips diverse statements of the I-narrator out of its context and interprets them as romantic advances becomes another running gag. In doing so, his reaction is not averse, but he keeps affirming that his professional ethics prevent him from getting to know his patients privately.\n\n\n== Form and language ==\nChronicles consists of 81 short stories which are told in present tense (except for Chapter 21, which is told metafictionally). The chapters are relatively short, at the most a dozen pages long. Some of the chapters end in abstracts from \"opportunism and repression\", which is the fundamental work of social science the Kangaroo is working on. Apart from this, the chapters' contents consist of dialogue between the Kangaroo and the Narrator. Those discussions use everyday language feature terms of dialect, foreign and loan words, and technical terms. Both the Kangaroo and the Narrator use idioms and expressions in other languages to illustrate the intellectual level of their discussions. Furthermore, the protagonists use footnotes to comment on certain aspects. In some chapters, quotes are featured before the main text, as it is custom in literature. These are mainly intended to be comical and absurd, due to misattribution. Originally coined by Kant, the following is misquoted by Kling to be said by Silvio Berlusconi:\n\nHandle stets nur nach derjenigen Maxime, durch die du zugleich wollen kannst, dass sie ein allgemeines Gesetz werde.\n(en: Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. Categorical imperative)\nThe author cites Monty Python and Calvin and Hobbes as his role models when it comes to humor.\n\n\n== Genre ==\nThe works of the Kangaroo Chronicles are not actual chronicles but satiric and episodic novels. The books show a high degree of allusions, intertextuality, word play, punch lines and running gags. All four books reference popular culture and contain homages to movies (among them Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Fight Club) and literature. The allusions to the Viet Cong, the GDR, the history of communist ideology and its various movements, politics and contemporary history require a certain amount of historical and general knowledge. However, that never stopped the Chronicles from being widely read and listened to, by adults as well as children.\nThe individual texts display characteristics of short stories: a straight, episodic plot; a limited number of characters (with a tendency towards stereotypes); a determined beginning and a succinct end constructed as a punch line; stylistically concise and suggestive language and in regards to content a tendency towards the extraordinary. However, in contrast to a typical short story the two protagonists are both present in the stories most of the time, creating a two character perspective structure. Because of the jokes and its easiness to be read out aloud, the whole work shows similarities to a poetry slam. There are also parallels to a fable as there are animal protagonists with human attributes and a critical, educative tenor, all of which results in a satirical effect.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Kangaroo Chronicles were received mostly positive by the cultural pages: The S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung described the author as a \"new high-flyer on the German cabaret scene\", the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung rated the columns as \"eloquent, amusing and fast-paced\", the radio station Deutschlandfunk Kultur praised: \"Kling writes subtly exaggerated and radically direct.\" In the opinion of Elisabeth von Thadden in the weekly newspaper Die Zeit Kling offers \"everything social philosophy has to offer in terms of social criticism: The kangaroo wants political participation (J\u00fcrgen Habermas), whines for recognition (Axel Honneth), needs love (Eva Illouz) and definitely resonance (Hartmut Rosa), seeks justice (John Rawls), wants to abolish the system (no one represents it any more), declares the biological gender difference irrelevant (Judith Butler). It wants to treat animals like humans (Martha Nussbaum) and suffocates in ambivalence (Zygmunt Bauman)\". Sophie Weigand, in Literaturen (a German literature magazine), wrote \"never has social criticism been so witty and so pointed at the same time, this book is not only alternative but also completely unrivalled. It is a satirical bible, precisely the Holy Scripture of the antisocial network.\" The satirical magazine Titanic, on the other hand, criticized that Kling \"first of all wants to make one joke after another and not hurt anyone. Which is why the political aspects of his books seem just as harmless, unmotivated and largely senseless as the whole thing in the first place. One must have a childlike disposition to be inspired by such things (Original German quote: \"zuv\u00f6rderst einen Jux nach dem anderen machen und niemandem wehtun. Weshalb denn auch das Politische seiner B\u00fccher genauso harmlos, unmotiviert und weitgehend sinnfrei daherkommt wie \u00fcberhaupt das ganze Klingeling. Man mu\u00df schon \u00fcber ein kindliches Gem\u00fct verf\u00fcgen, um sich von so etwas begeistern zu lassen.\").\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Stage/theatre ===\nA first theatre play of the Kangaroo Chronicles by Isabelle Chastenier and Benjamin Muth was staged at the Eduard-von-Winterstein-Theater in Annaberg-Buchholz in 2015. After that, guest performances in, inter alia, Berlin (Brotfabrik), Dresden (Johannstadthalle) and Freiburg (Wallgraben-Theater) followed. In 2016, Hans Schernthaner adapted the book for the stage. Under his direction, the Kangaroo Chronicles were staged at the Altonaer Theater. The cast consisted of Stephan M\u00f6ller-Titel as Marc-Uwe and Robert Zimmermann as the kangaroo.\n\n\n=== Movie ===\nFilming of the movie The Kangaroo Chronicles (Die K\u00e4nguru-Chroniken) began on September 26, 2018, in and around Berlin. The movie was produced by X-Film and the ZDF. It was directed by Dani Levy. Marc-Uwe Kling took responsibility for the script. The film is a combination of real film and computer animation. It was released in German cinemas on March 5, 2020, after being delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCritical and public reception of the film was mixed.\nA sequel, The Kangaroo Conspiracy (Die K\u00e4nguru-Verschw\u00f6rung) was released in cinemas on August 25th, 2022.\n\n\n== English translations ==\nKling, Marc-Uwe.

            "Keilschrifttexte aus Assur religi\u00f6sen Inhalts, often abbreviated as KAR, is a two-volume German publication by the Assyriologist Erich Ebeling from 1919 to 1923. The work offers a critical edition of several hundred cuneiform tablets discovered during 1903\u20131914 German excavations directed by Walter Andrae and Julius Jordan in the former Assyrian capital city Assur, dating to the reign of Ashurbanipal (7th century BC). The compiled inscriptions also form one of the main primary sources for the tablets used in reconstructing the famous creation epic, the Enuma Elish. Inscriptions in KAR are itemized according to the order of their appearance in the work. Therefore, the 34th tablet is numbered as KAR 34. Volume 1 contains inscriptions KAR 1\u2013175, and Volume 2 contains inscriptions KAR 176\u2013472.\nOne of the most important inscriptions from KAR is KAR 307, an inscription from the 1st millennium BC with 63 lines that contain a concentrated amount of information in helping understand the ancient near eastern cosmos. Another significant tablet from Ebeling's collection is KAR 158, which continues to be studied as containing one of the closest parallels to the biblical Song of Songs. KAR 44, otherwise known as the Exorcists Manual and composed by a figure named Esagil-kin-apli, is also prominent. Several important medical texts would also be included, but a future, more dedicated work by Ebeling and Reginald Campbell Thompson, namely the four-volume Keilschrifttexte medizinischen Inhalts, presented a collection of works that quickly surpassed KAR in enabling a broader understanding of Babylonian and Assyrian medicine.\nA number of inscriptions from KAR have been digitized and more information about them can now be found on databases including the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative and Oracc (Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus).\n\n\n== See also ==\nElectronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL)\nKeilalphabetische Texte aus Ugarit\nPatrologia Graeca\nSynodicon orientale\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGeller, M.J.

            "Last Letters from Stalingrad (German: Letzte Briefe aus Stalingrad) is an anthology of letters from German soldiers who took part in the Battle for Stalingrad during World War II.  Originally published in West Germany in 1950, the book was translated into many languages (into English by Anthony G. Powell in 1956), and has been issued in numerous editions.\nThe German High Command wished to gauge the morale of the troops of the encircled 6th Army, so they allowed the soldiers to write and send the letters which became the basis for Last Letters from Stalingrad. The letters were then impounded, opened, stripped of identification and sorted by content, before eventually being stored in archives.\nUnlike the usual military history accounts focusing on mass armies of anonymous men, the reader is presented with the personal tragedies of individual soldiers, the \"single human being ... in the face of death\", getting a tangible impression of the horrors of war.  The letters are a \"human document which bares the soul of the man at his worst hour\", and by softening the identification of Germany with Nazism the book helped Germany to take its place in the Western post-war community of nations.\nFrench president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supposedly carried the French edition with him in the last months of his life, and drew inspiration from it in writing his speech for the 50th anniversary of the end of the war on the 8 May 1995.\n\n\n== Questioned authenticy ==\nGerman jurist and legal scholar Wilhelm Raimund Beyer has questioned the authenticity of the letters. He questions their authenticity based on the textual style and based on his own experiences during the Battle of Stalingrad.\nThe historian Jens Ebert has accused the former German war reporter of Propagandakompanie 637 attached to the 6th Army during the war Heinz Schr\u00f6ter to have written the book.\nThe letters refuse to admit the complete hopelessness of the 6th Army, and in fact (cited from letters never to be delivered, either pulled from corpses or retained by advancing Soviet troops), even the German Luftwaffe were being mauled by inadequate Russian fighter planes. These last pathetic realizations were censored by postmasters so as not to stain German invincibility at home. Publishing edited versions could stir up nationalism and hatred of the enemy\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe book inspired two works of contemporary music theater: a chamber music piece by New York composer Elias Tanenbaum, and the 1998 Symphonie No.10 \"Letzte briefe aus Stalingrad\" of French composer Aubert Lemeland, a collage of music and recitation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBattle of Stalingrad in popular culture\n\n\n== References ==",
            "The Last of the Nuba is the English-language title of German film director Leni Riefenstahl's 1973 Die Nuba, a book of photographs, published a year later in the United States. It was an international bestseller and was followed up by the 1976 book Die Nuba von Kau. It was the subject of a famous critique by Susan Sontag claiming that it adhered to a \"fascist aesthetic\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\nBetween 1962 and 1977, Riefenstahl had been photographing people of different Nuba ethnic groups in the southern part of Sudan on several visits. She was the first white female photographer who had obtained a special permission by the Sudanese government to do her research in the remote Nuba mountains of Sudan. She observed the Nuba's way of life and recorded it on film and in pictures. For some of her photographs and film scenes, she relied on Sudanese cameraman Gadalla Gubara, who accompanied her to the Nuba mountains.\nTogether with George Rodger's earlier photo essay on the Nuba and Latuka tribes, published in 1951 in National Geographic magazine, Riefenstahl's photographic documents are of anthropological, ethnological, and cultural-historical importance in relation to traditional life in the Nuba mountains of these times.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn her native Germany, the Art Director's Club of Germany awarded Riefenstahl a gold medal for the best photographic achievement of 1975.\nShortly after its 1974 release in America, the critic Susan Sontag scrutinized the \"fascist aesthetics\" of the works in her essay \"Fascinating Fascism\". Writing in the New York Review of Books in 1975, she stated: \"The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets\".  She continued \"Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing. Sontag wrote that the collection was the \"final, necessary step in Riefenstahl's rehabilitation. It is the final rewrite of the past; or, for her partisans, the definitive confirmation that she was always a beauty-freak rather than a horrid propagandist.\" \nIn December 1974, American writer and photographer Eudora Welty reviewed the book positively for the New York Times, giving a personal account of the aesthetics of Riefenstahl's book:\n\nShe uses the light purposefully: the full, blinding brightness to make us see the ail\u2010absorbing blackness of the skin; the ray of light slanting down from the single hole, high in the wall, that is the doorway of the circular house, which tells us how secret and safe it has been made; the first dawn light streaking the face of a calf in the sleeping camp where the young men go to live, which suggests their world apart. All the pictures bring us the physical beauty of the people: a young girl, shy and mischievous of face, with a bead sewn into her lower lip like a permanent cinnamon drop; a wrestler prepared for his match, with his shaven head turned to look over the massive shoulder, all skin color taken away by a coating of ashes.\nAcademic studies, giving critical appraisals of Riefenstahl's books on the Nuba people, have been published by Alexandra Ludewig of the University of Western Australia and by anthropologist James C. Faris of the University of Connecticut. In his biography on Riefenstahl, the German media critic Rainer Rother gives a detailed account of her repeated visits to the Nuba people, comparing her approach to taking the photographs that seem to have started with a personal fascination of an African world, \"unspoilt by civilization\", up to her later carefully planned photo expeditions in order to further her fame as a photographer.\nAnother examination of both Riefenstahl's books and of James C. Faris's criticism was undertaken as a comment on a television film, called The Nuba from the BBC \u201cWorlds Apart\u201d ethnographic series. Here, the author John Ryle describes both the approach of the German photographer and of the anthropologist, trying to do justice to both. Also, he questions the attitude and moral judgements of the admirers of such \"exotic pictures from Africa\".\n\nWe feel guilt at the pleasure we take in their beauty and their sensuality. One reason for this is because we know that it is, to a significant extent, the forces unleashed on the world by our own civilisation that are destroying such cultures, even as we celebrate them.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNuba\nGeorge Rodger\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGeorge Paul Meiu: Riefenstahl on Safari.

            "Lectures on Theoretical Physics is a six-volume series of physics textbooks translated from Arnold Sommerfeld's classic German texts Vorlesungen \u00fcber Theoretische Physik. The series includes the volumes Mechanics, Mechanics of Deformable Bodies, Electrodynamics, Optics, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, and Partial Differential Equations in Physics. Focusing on one subject each semester, the lectures formed a three-year cycle of courses that Sommerfeld repeatedly taught at the University of Munich for over thirty years. Sommerfeld's lectures were famous and he was held to be one of the greatest physics lecturers of his time.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSommerfeld was a well known German theoretical physicist who played a major role in developing old quantum theory. He was renowned as a great teacher of theoretical physics in the early 20th century. Wolfgang Pauli wrote in 1951 that Sommerfeld was \"the epitome of the scholar and the teacher\". Another physicist, summarizing \"the roles of the most important exponents of theoretical physics in its 'golden age'\", wrote that \"Planck was the authority, Einstein the genius, and Sommerfeld the teacher\" in a 1973 biography of Max Planck. Summarizing public reception of Sommerfeld's teaching style, Robert Bruce Lindsay wrote in 1954 that it \"is generally admitted that as an effective lecturer Sommerfeld has been rarely if ever surpassed.\"\nThe textbooks, originally published in German, were based on series of his lectures, which were made to be self-consistent within each section, at the University of Munich that ran over a three-year cycle. In addition to specialized classes, the set of lectures presented by the book represent Sommerfeld's standard introductory courses in physics that he gave in Munich, with each subject taught over one semester for a total of three years. Sommerfeld continued this cycle of lectures for over thirty years at the university, which were very popular and influential.\nIn addition to his normal lectures, Sommerfeld also lectured in specialized courses, including courses in atomic physics that form the subject of another of his books: Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines, which was published in 1919. The world-famous textbook is known as the \"Bible of atomic physics\".  His other previous works included another lecture series titled Three lectures on atomic physics, which was published in 1926 by Methuen Publishing. He had also edited the book series Die Theorie des Kreisels, which was based on a set of lectures given by his mentor Felix Klein.\n\n\n== Volumes ==\nThere are six volumes to the lecture series, Mechanics, Mechanics of deformable bodies, Electrodynamics, Optics, Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics, and Partial Differential Equations in Physics, which all follow a semester course given by Sommerfeld at the University of Munich. Characterizing the series, Rudolf Peierls wrote in 1956 that they exemplify \"Sommerfeld's attitude of putting practical problems and their solution above abstract principles, an attitude by its nature closer to Boltzmann than to that of Gibbs.\"\n\n\n=== Mechanics ===\nMechanik, the first volume of Sommerfeld's Vorlesungen \u00fcber Theoretische Physik, was published in 1947 by Akademische Verlagegesellschaft Becker und Erler and subsequently translated into English by Martin O. Stern and published as Mechanics in 1953 by the Academic Press. Paul Peter Ewald wrote a foreword for the English edition where he attempts to summarize Sommerfeld's lecture style and use the information to explain why Sommerfeld had so many successful students.\nThe book was reviewed by Robert Bruce Lindsay, Rudolf Peierls, William V. Houston, and several others. In his 1954 review of the volume, Lindsay wrote that Sommerfeld's \"clarity is indeed remarkably well exemplified\" by the mechanics textbook and he praised the book for its \"many ingenious comments to help the learner over the rough spots\". Lindsay noted regret for the lack of an extended discussion of mass and force in physics before going on to write that the \"book can be heartily recommended to all students of physics on the undergraduate senior and elementary graduate levels in American universities\".\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\n=== Mechanics of Deformable Bodies ===\nMechanics of deformable bodies, the second volume of the series, was published in English in 1950 by Academic Press. The book was translated from the German volume Mechanik der deformierbaren Medien by G. Kuerti. The second volume covers topics including hydrodynamics and elasticity, which are discussed together, as well as more advanced topics like supersonic flow and shock waves.\nThe volume was reviewed by Rudolf Peierls. In his review, Peierls argued that covering hydrodynamics and elastics together allowed for the \"general principles\" to \"be treated in a concise and transparent way\". Peierls went on to note that it emphasizes physical principles even to the detriment of its treatment of mathematical techniques. At the end of his review of several of four of the book's volumes, Peierls closed by saying: \"To me these volumes represent an almost perfect choice of topics for a basic course on theoretical physics\".\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\n=== Electrodynamics ===\nElectrodynamics, published in 1964 by Academic Press, is the third volume of its series and covers topics in electrodynamics. The book was translated from the German volume Elektrodynamik by Edward Ramberg.  The book was reviewed by Rudolf Peierls, among several others.\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\n=== Optics ===\nThe series' fourth volume, Optics, was published in 1954 by Academic Press after being translated from the German textbook Optik by Otto Laporte and Peter A. Moldauer. The book was reviewed by Karl Meissner, Rudolf Peierls, and several others. Max Born wrote in 1952 that the book gives \"a very elegant outline\" of Cherenkov radiation. In his 1955 review, Karl Meissner wrote that the book is characteristic of Sommerfeld's lectures, which he summarized as \"[c]lear and vivid presentation[s] of the basic ideas\" with an \"elegance in language and of mathematical developments\" and an \"emphasis on physics.\" Peierls called the book \"a very welcome addition to the literature\" in his 1955 review and he praised the book, like the other lectures, for \"the use of powerful mathematical techniques\" that are \"presented and applied without losing sight of the physical ideas behind them.\"\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\n=== Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics ===\nThermodynamik und Statistik, the fifth volume of Sommerfeld's Lectures, was edited by Fritz Bopp and Josef Meixner and published posthumously in 1952 by Dieterich'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung. The book was translated into the English volume Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics by Joseph Kestin and published in 1956 by Academic Press. The book was reviewed by Rudolf Peierls and several others. After summarizing the book's contents in his 1956 review of the volume, Peierls wrote, \"The book is a welcome addition to the text-books on this subject.\"\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\n=== Partial Differential Equations in Physics ===\nPartielle Differentialgleichungen in der Physik, the sixth and final volume of its series, was published in 1947 by Dieterich'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung while it was translated to English by Ernst G. Straus and published by Academic Press in 1949 under the title Partial Differential Equations in Physics. The book was reviewed by George F. Carrier, Michael Golomb, Rudolf Peierls, and Lincoln LaPaz. After summarizing the book's contents, Carrier closed his 1952 review by writing: \"The book contains an excellent choice of very instructive problems and should be invaluable in teaching the technique of solving the classical type boundary value problems.\" In his 1950 review, Golomb wrote that the book is \"concise and very readable\" and that its \"chief merit\" is \"its skillful handling of complex problems\". LaPaz gave a critical review going into detail on several issues before summarizing the review himself: \"In conclusion, on balancing out the few quite minor imperfections of the book under review against its many excellences, the reader will not hesitate to accord hearty commendation to author, translator and editors alike for tasks exceedingly well done.\"\n\nTable of contents:\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== Original German editions ===\nSommerfeld, Arnold (1947).

            "Letters to a Young Poet (original title, in German: Briefe an einen jungen Dichter) is a collection of ten letters written by the Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875\u20131926) to Franz Xaver Kappus (1883\u20131966), a 19-year-old officer cadet at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. Rilke, the son of an Austrian army officer, had studied at the academy's lower school at Sankt P\u00f6lten in the 1890s. Kappus corresponded with the popular poet and author from 1902 to 1908 seeking his advice as to the quality of his poetry, and in deciding between a literary career or a career as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Kappus compiled and published the letters in 1929\u2014three years after Rilke's death from leukemia.\nIn the first letter, Rilke respectfully declines to review or criticize Kappus' poetry, advising the younger Kappus that \"Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself.\" Rilke, over the course of the ten letters, proceeds to advise Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process. Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of Das Stunden-Buch (The Book of Hours) and Das Buch der Bilder (The Book of Images).\n\n\n== Writing and publication ==\n\n\n=== Correspondence with Rilke ===\nIn 1929, Franz Xaver Kappus compiled ten letters that he received from Rainer Maria Rilke that were written from 1902 to 1908 and published them under the title Briefe an einen jungen Dichter (Letters to a Young Poet) through Insel Verlag in Leipzig. Later information revealed that Rilke and Kappus did meet in person.\nIn an introduction to the collection, Kappus recounts how he came to write to Rainer Maria Rilke. According to Kappus, in late 1902 while a student at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria, he was reading Rilke's poetry. He was approached by the academy's chaplain, Horacek, who noted that Rilke had been a pupil years earlier at the academy's lower school at Sankt P\u00f6lten. Horacek expressed surprise that the former pupil had \"become a poet\" and described to Kappus the young Rilke as a \"thin, pale boy\" whose quiet demeanor proved unable to bear the strain of a military education and life. Rilke did not continue his military education. At the time that Kappus learned this he was inclined toward writing and was not very keen on the notion of dedicating his life to the military. Kappus then decided to write to Rilke for advice.\nWhen Kappus wrote his first letter to Rilke he asked for Rilke to provide a critique of his poetry. Rilke provided the young Kappus very little in criticism or in suggestions for his improvement as a poet. Instead, Rilke discouraged Kappus from reading criticism and advised him to trust his inner judgment, commenting that \"Nobody can advise you and help you. Nobody. There is only one way\u2014Go into yourself.\" Rilke provided advice that inspired Kappus to search broader issues of intimacy and the nature of beauty and art, as well as probing philosophical and existential questions. The letters address personal issues that Kappus had apparently revealed to Rilke; ranging from atheism, loneliness, and career choices.\nThe originally published collection does not include Kappus's letters to Rilke, though the original German collection does include one sonnet of Kappus's own that Rilke sent back to him in Rilke's handwriting with the instruction to \"Read the lines as if they were unknown to you, and you will feel in your inmost self how very much they are yours.\" However, in 2017, the letters from Kappus to Rilke were found in the Rilke family archive. Kappus's letters were published in German in 2019, and an English translation was published in 2020.\n\n\n=== Rilke's influence on Kappus ===\n\nAside from his role in writing to Rilke and later publishing these letters, Franz Xaver Kappus (1883\u20131966) is largely forgotten by history. Kappus was descended from a Banat Swabian (ethnic German) family born in Timi\u0219oara, in the Banat region, now divided between Hungary, Serbia and Romania. Despite the hesitancy he expressed in his letters to Rilke about pursuing a military career, he continued his military studies and served for 15 years as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. During the course of his life, he worked as a newspaper editor and journalist, writing poems, humorous sketches, short-stories, novels, and adapted several works (including his own) into screenplays for films in the 1930s. However, Kappus did not achieve lasting fame.\n\n\n== The Letters ==\n\n\n=== The first letter ===\nWritten in Paris, France on 17 February 1903 \u2013 Rilke writes that criticism fails to \"touch a work of art.\" He urges the reader to eschew others' opinions of his poetry. Instead, the young poet should look inward and examine what truly motivates him to continue writing. Rilke expands on the theme of developing a rich inner life and offers an inspiring perspective on the process of creating art.\n\n\n=== The second letter ===\nWritten in Viareggio, near Pisa, Italy on 5 April 1903 \u2013 Rilke describes two focuses for his second letter: the first is irony, which he urges the young poet to be wary of, and in the second section, he recommends the books that \"are indispensable to [him],\" specifically \"the Bible and the books of the great Danish writer, Jens Peter Jacobsen.\"\n\n\n=== The third letter ===\nWritten in Viareggio, near Pisa, Italy on 23 April 1903 \u2013 Rilke discusses Niels Lyhne and Marie Grubbe by Jens Peter Jacobsen in relation to the nature of art.\n\"In this there is no measuring with time. A year doesn\u2019t matter; ten years are nothing. To be an artist means not to compute or count; it means to ripen as the tree, which does not force its sap, but stands unshaken in the storms of spring with no fear that summer might not follow. It will come regardless. But it comes only to those who live as though eternity stretches before them, carefree, silent, and endless. I learn it daily, learn it with many pains, for which I am grateful: Patience is all!\"\nIn the second section of the letter, Rilke critiques the work of Richard Dehmel: \"For him there exists no totally mature and pure world of sex, none that is simply human and not masculine only.\" Rilke argues that rooting art that deals with love in gender \"disfigure[s]\" it, and that \"there is in [Dehmel's] perception something spiteful, seemingly wild, something temporal, not eternal. There is something that detracts from his art, and makes it suggestive and questionable.\"\nYet despite this criticism, Rilke argues that there are elements to be appreciated in Dehmel's work.\nRilke concludes the third letter lamenting that he is too poor to send the young poet copies of his own books.\n\n\n=== The fourth letter ===\nWritten in Worpswede, near Bremen, Germany on 16 July 1903 \u2013 Rilke describes love and sexuality, encouraging the young poet to love questions rather than answers. He writes that:\n\"Physical lust is a sensuous experience no different from innocently viewing something, or from the feeling of pure delight when a wonderful ripe fruit fills the tongue. It is a glorious infinite experience granted us, a gift of knowledge from the world, the fullness and radiance of all knowing. It is not bad that we welcome it. What is bad is that almost all misuse and waste it. They set it out as a lure in dreary places of their lives and use it as a distraction rather than as a focus on great heights.\"\nAnd he goes on to describe the relationship between spiritual creativity and physical desire and satisfaction.\nRilke also elaborates on the limitations of a gendered world-view introduced in his third letter. He writes that:\n\"Perhaps the sexes are more closely related than one would think. Perhaps the great renewal of the world will consist of this, that man and woman, freed of all confused feelings and desires, shall no longer seek each other as opposites, but simply as members of a family and neighbors, and will unite as human beings, in order to simply, earnestly, patiently, and jointly bear the heavy responsibility of sexuality that has been entrusted to them.\"\nThe fourth letter concludes with an affirmation of Mr. Kappus's choice of career in the military, telling him to \"Wait patiently to see if your inner life feels restricted by the conditions of this career.\"\n\n\n=== The fifth letter ===\nWritten in Rome, Italy on 29 October 1903 \u2013 Rilke opens the letter with complaints about Rome, at first claiming it \"exudes a death-like, dreary atmosphere, typical of museums.\" He finds that the abundance of historical objects preserved throughout the city is stifling to daily life, that they assert a connection to Roman history purely coincidental, for it is \"of another era and another kind of life, which is not ours and should not be considered as our own.\" He describes the tourist attractions as \"over-rated.\"\nBut then Rilke describes his process of realizing Rome's beauty, telling the young poet that \"there is much beauty here because there is much beauty everywhere.\" Rilke comes to see beauty in the ancient aqueducts, the city gardens, and the Renaissance sculptures and architecture.\n\n\n=== The sixth letter ===\nWritten in Rome, Italy on 23 December 1903 \u2013 Rilke reminds the young poet of the benefits of solitude, telling him:\n\"To be lonely as one was lonely as a child, while adults were moving about, entangled with things that seemed big and important, because the grownups looked so busy and because one could not understand any of their doings \u2014 that must be the goal. And when you realize one day that their activities are superficial, that their careers are paralyzed and no longer linked with life, then why not look at the world as a child would see it \u2014 out of the depths of your own world, out of the breadth of your own aloneness, which is itself work and rank and career?\"\nRilke goes on to warn the reader of the pitfalls of social or career ambitions. He is writing in the days leading up to Christmas, and focuses the end of his letter on the process of finding God.\n\n\n=== The seventh letter ===\nWritten in Rome, Italy on 14 May 1904 \u2013 Rilke focuses this letter on love and relationships, specifically on the necessity of aloneness. He writes:\n\"It is true that many young people who do not love rightly, who simply surrender themselves and leave no room for aloneness, experience the depressing feeling of failure.\"\n\n\n=== The eighth letter ===\nWritten in Fl\u00e4die, Sweden on 12 August 1904 \u2013 Rilke writes about grief and sadness, telling the young poet to let such \"moments of tension\" pass like all other moments are destined to.\n\n\n=== The ninth letter ===\nWritten in Jonsered, Sweden on 4 November 1904 \u2013 Feelings and discipline are discussed in brief, though the ninth and tenth letters are Rilke's shortest, with minimal elaboration such themes.\n\n\n=== The tenth letter ===\nWritten in Paris, France on 26 December 1908 \u2013 Short in length, Rilke's tenth and final published letter concludes with a short discussion of art as a way of life. He expresses skepticism of \"half-artistic\" careers, and he encourages the young poet to remain strong in his resolve.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArt of Mentoring\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRainer Maria Rilke \u2013 Letters to a Young Poet \u2013 The first letter (full text in: EN FR DE IT ES CH)\nThe Letters (German): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\nOnline text source",
            "Liberalism (original German title: Liberalismus) is a book by Austrian School economist and libertarian thinker Ludwig von Mises, containing economic analysis and indicting critique of socialism. It was first published in 1927 by Gustav Fischer Verlag in Jena and defending classical liberal ideology based on individual property rights. Starting from the principle of private property, Mises shows how the other classical liberal freedoms follow from property rights and argues that liberalism free of government intervention is required to promote peace, social harmony and the general welfare. The book was translated into English by a student of Mises, Ralph Raico, but its first English edition in 1962 was titled The Free and Prosperous Commonwealth rather than Liberalism, as Mises thought that the literal translation would create confusion because the term liberalism after the New Deal and especially in the 1960s became widely used in the United States to refer to a centre-left politics that supports degrees of government intervention, in opposition to Mises' central premise. The English translation was made available online by the Ludwig von Mises Institute in 2000.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\n\n\n=== In German ===\nLudwig von Mises, Liberalismus.

            "The Lord (German: Der Herr) is a Christological book by Romano Guardini, a Roman Catholic priest and academic. It was first published in Germany in 1937 by Werkbund-Verlag, and an English-language translation was published in 1954 by Henry Regnery Company.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn The Lord, Guardini wishes to present a correct understanding of Jesus by writing about his life and person, with all the limitations which the subject necessarily imposes. Although Christ lived in a specific historical milieu, and though knowledge of the forces at work in it furthers an understanding of him, Guardini states that a biography of Christ is practicable only within the narrowest confines. Neither Jesus' personality nor his works are immediately traceable to the conditions of the times, for he came \"out of the fullness of time contained in the mystery of God, and it was to this mystery that he returned after he had moved among us (Acts 1:22).\"\nIn The Lord, Guardini points to certain decisive events in Jesus' life, recognising specific directions in it and watching their sense evince and fulfill itself; but he also affirms that one shall never be able to ascertain a genuine evolution of character in the life of Jesus. It is equally impossible to motivate the unwinding of Christ's destiny or the manner in which he accomplished his designated mission, for the ultimate explanations - Guardini states - are to be found only in that impenetrable territory which Jesus calls \"my Father's will\" \u2014 territory forever beyond the reach of history. So Guardini ponders such words as \"And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age and grace before God and men\" (Luke 2:52), and the passage in the Epistle to the Galatians which describes him as one \"in the fullness of time,\" ripening to maturity deeply conscious of the history about him.\nGuardini's book typifies modern exegetical criticism, approaching Jesus Christ through the Gospels, placing his life in the context of history and showing how his teachings are related to the whole body of church doctrine and practice. He does not attempt to recount Jesus' life in a chronological or logical sequence. Rather, he selects certain teachings, events, traits, and miracles and meditates upon them, offering considerations and commentary.\nConsidered a masterpiece by Catholic scholars, The Lord has remained in print for decades and, according to Henry Regnery, was \"one of the most successful books I have ever published.\" The novelist Flannery O'Connor thought it \"very fine\" and recommended it to a number of her friends.\nIn an introduction to a 21st-century edition of Guardini's book, Pope Benedict XVI wrote: \"The Lord has not grown old, precisely because it still leads us to that which is essential, to that which is truly real, Jesus Christ Himself. That is why today this book still has a great mission.\"\n\n\n== Excerpt ==\nUnderstanding of Christ requires a complete conversion, not only of the will and the deed, but also of the mind. One must cease to judge the Lord from the wordly point of view and learn to accept his own measure of the genuine and the possible; to judge the world with his eyes. This revolution is difficult to accept and still more difficult to realize, and the more openly the world contradicts Christ's teaching, the more earnestly it defines those who accept it as fools, the more difficult that acceptance, realization. Nevertheless, to the degree that the intellect honestly attempts this right-about-face, the reality known as Jesus Christ will surrender itself. From this central reality, the doors of all other reality will swing open, and it will be lifted into the hope of the new creation.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nJesus Christ\nChristology\nChristian Theology\nJesuism\nRedeemer (Christianity)\nLost years of Jesus\nList of books about Jesus\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Four meditations from The Lord\", on Paying Attention\n\"Introduction by Cardinal Ratzinger\", Eternal Word Television Network",

            "Man and Technics: A Contribution to a Philosophy of Life (German: Der Mensch und die Technik) is a 1931 book by Oswald Spengler, in which the author discusses a critique of technology and industrialism and uses the Nietzschean concept of the will to power to understand man's nature.\nBuilding on his previous ideas in The Decline of the West, Spengler argues that many of the Western world's great achievements may soon become spectacles for our descendants to marvel at, as we do with the pyramids of Egypt or the baths of Rome. He  points in particular to the tendency of Western technology to spread to hostile \"colored races\" which would then use the weapons against the West. In Spengler's view, western culture will be destroyed from within by materialism, and destroyed by others through economic competition and warfare. \n\nThe book ends in the famous passage, indicating that to Faustian man:\"[a]lready the danger is so great, for every individual, every class, every people, that to cherish any illusion whatever is deplorable. Time does not suffer itself to be halted; there is no question of prudent retreat or wise renunciation. Only dreamers believe that there is a way out. Optimism is cowardice.We are born into this time and must bravely follow the path to the destined end. There is no other way. Our duty is to hold on to the lost position, without hope, without rescue, like that Roman soldier whose bones were found in front of a door in Pompeii, who, during the eruption of Vesuvius, died at his post because they forgot to relieve him. That is greatness. That is what it means to be a thoroughbred. The honourable end is the one thing that can not be taken from a man.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe twelfth and final part of the book\nThe New York Review of Books review by H.

            "The Manipulated Man (German: Der dressierte Mann) is a 1971 book by author Esther Vilar, originally written in German and translated to English by Eva Borneman. The main idea behind the book is that women are not oppressed by men but rather control men to their advantage. A third edition of the book was released in January 2009.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe book argues that, contrary to common feminist and women's rights rhetoric, women in industrialized cultures are not oppressed, but rather exploit a well-established system of manipulating men.\nVilar writes, \"Men have been trained and conditioned by women, not unlike the way Pavlov conditioned his dogs, into becoming their slaves. As compensation for their labours men are given periodic use of a woman's vagina.\" The book contends that young boys are encouraged to associate their masculinity with their ability to be sexually intimate with a woman, and that a woman can control a man by socially empowering herself to be the gate-keeper to his sense of masculinity. Vilar states that this has been going on for some time.\nThe author says that social definitions and norms, such as the idea that women are weak, are constructed by women with their needs in mind.  Vilar explains how it works: if women are viewed as weak, less is expected of them; and therefore they are given more leeway in society than men.  Vilar states that women are generally \"gold diggers\" who attempt to extract money and other material resources from men. One means by which women control men to effect this transfer of resources is praise. Women dole out praise to men only when their needs are met in some way.\nAnother means of manipulation is the calculated use of emotional displays. Vilar claims that women can control their emotional reactions whereas men cannot, and that women create overly-dramatized emotional reactions to get their way: they \"blackmail\" men emotionally. Women also use sex as a tool of manipulation and control but also traditional concepts of love and romance, which are seen more positively than sex, to control men's sexual lives. Vilar writes that men gain nothing from marriage and that women coerce them into it under the pretense that it fulfills their romantic desires.\nThe book closes with Vilar stating that it would be difficult to change the situation by appealing to women, as women are unsympathetic to the plight of men, and unwilling to give up their comfortable position in society.  It is up to men to see past the deception and emotional blackmail and subject it to open criticism before any meaningful changes can occur.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Manipulated Man was quite popular at the time of its release, in part due to the considerable press coverage it received.\nVilar appeared on The Tonight Show on February 21, 1973, to discuss her book. In 1975 she was invited to a televised debate by WDR with Alice Schwarzer, who was considered as the leading representative of the women's movement in Germany at that time. The debate provoked controversy, in particular for its high degree of aggression. At one point, for example, Schwarzer claimed Vilar was \"not only sexist, but fascist\", and compared her book with the Nazi newspaper Der St\u00fcrmer.\nVilar stated that she received death threats over the book: \"So I hadn't imagined broadly enough the isolation I would find myself in after writing this book. Nor had I envisaged the consequences which it would have for subsequent writing and even for my private life\u2014violent threats have not ceased to this date.\"\n\n\n== Sales ==\nAccording to research from the Spanish Book Institute, the Spanish translated version (under the title El Var\u00f3n Domado) was the third-most popular book sold in Spain in 1975.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAntifeminism\nMen Going Their Own Way\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVilar, Esther. \"Author's Introduction to \"The Manipulated Man\"\".

            "The book Mary Ward  by Ida Friederike G\u00f6rres (n\u00e9e von Coudenhove) presents the life of Catholic nun Venerable Mary Ward (1585 \u20131645). It was originally published in German in 1932 by Verlag Anton Pustet under the title Mary Ward: Eine Heldenlegende and republished in 1952 by Verlag Herder under the title Das grosse Spiel der Maria Ward. It was translated into English by Elise Codd and published as Mary Ward in London in 1939 by Longmans, Green and Co.\nG\u00f6rres was likely inspired in part by her education at a convent school for girls in St. P\u00f6lten, Austria, run by nuns who belonged to an order founded by Mary Ward.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nIn the author's note to Mary Ward, Ida G\u00f6rres cites multiple biographies about Mary which she used to verify the historical accuracy of her book. However, she also recreates various imagined details such as dialogue to better retell her story. She writes:\n\nThe setting of the scenes and the dialogue is, of course, for the greatest part imaginary. But I have not added a single event or episode to the material I found ready in [Mary Ward's] biographies. As to the conversations and even soliloquies assigned to Mary Ward herself, they are...chiefly built up from...speeches and thoughts of her own as are recorded in [her] letters, discourses, spiritual diaries, and notes.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMary Ward is separated into four sections. The first details Ward's early life living with her family in Mulwith, West Riding of Yorkshire, England throughout her childhood and early life, up until she decides to join a monastery in northern France. During this period, she goes to live with her grandparents and meets her aunt Martha as well as Martha's servant, Meg. Martha takes Mary to get her fortune told by a fortune teller, who says that Mary will travel to foreign places during her life. Then, she receives news that her younger brother has been born, so she returns to live with her parents. As she grows older, Mary starts to dream of becoming a nun, while her parents begin positioning her for marriage. Eventually, Mary's father decides that she will marry Edward Neville, heir to become the Earl of Westmorland, but Mary refuses, and after her two aunts are arrested and convicted in the Gunpowder Plot, she leaves England and joins a monastery of Poor Clares at Saint Omer in northern France. \n\nThe second section describes Mary's life in the monastery. Mary meets Father Keynes, who directs her to the Poor Clares monastery, saying that \"God has decided [on a convent] for you.\" However, she quickly realizes that she isn't well-suited to life at the convent, as her days become dull and fatiguing with little time for real spiritual contemplation. On Visitation Day, Mary receives an audience with the General Commissioner, who rules over the convents in Flanders and northern Germany, and she outlines to him a plan to create an English-speaking Poor Clares convent, to better benefit English-speaking nuns. Over the next several weeks and months, she helps direct the establishment of the new convent, and eventually, the project is completed. However, section two ends as Mary then receives a sign from God and realizes that she must leave the monastery. The third and longest section begins with Mary returning to England and her family, and going back to normal life. She soon finds herself surrounded by a group of friends, including Winefrid Wigmore, determined to travel with her wherever she goes and support her endeavors. With their encouragement, Mary decides to take her friends with her back to St. Omer and, using their help, starts a Catholic girls' school. As she reveals to Winefrid, Mary plans on creating a women's institution for apostolic ministry similar to that of the Society of Jesus. The venture becomes successful, but it is also met with much controversy, as many believe that women are not cut out for missionary work. To try and acquire the sanction of the Holy See, which would grant her institution legitimacy, Mary decides to go to Rome and request an audience with Pope Urban VIII. \nMary and her companions make the perilous journey to Rome on foot and arrive on Christmas Eve. Mary receives a Papal audience, but her requests go nowhere and eventually, she opens a school there, so that the Church can examine her work and thus verify that it is legitimate. Mary, along with a few other companions, then journeys across Europe to, among other places, Naples, Perugia, Munich, Vienna, and Prague, establishing schools as she goes. Because of her extensive travel on foot, Mary's health increasingly deteriorates, and at times she approaches the brink of death. She also continues her appeals to the Catholic Church that her schools be sanctioned, but is unsuccessful in her attempts, and many continue to be hostile to her, saying that her institutes are \"nothing more nor less than heresy in disguise, a self-glorification of women, . . . a contempt of authority, dangerous exaltation, and a mania for spiritual adventure.\" Mary finally returns to Munich, but there she is greeted with a warrant for her arrest for being a heretic, schismatic, and instigator of revolt. Thus, she is imprisoned in a convent and because of this, her health begins to slowly decline. Mary is, however, able to continue contact with the outside world thanks to coded letters written with lemon juice as invisible ink. \nEventually, Mary receives an opportunity to write to the Pope and, acknowledging her fault and asking pardon for her offenses, requests to be set free. After a few weeks, the answer arrives from Rome, ordering that Mary be immediately released, which ends section three.\nSection four chronicles Mary's final journey to Rome, return to England, and death after the beginning of the English Civil War. In Rome, she establishes a house for English refugees of the civil war and stays for some time in their company, but as her health continues to get worse and Mary realizes that she is dying, she decides that she wants to be buried in England. After traveling back to her home country, she settles in Heworth, near York, while the war continues around them. There, Mary dies, surrounded by her followers. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nG\u00f6rres's Mary Ward has been generally well-received and is valued as an important work of biography as well as hagiography. In Blackfriars, Margaret Murphy observes, \"the book is ... delightful, and the writer, though dealing with her subject in a decidedly subjective manner, has handled Mary's inner life with commendable reticence and respect\"; at the same time, Murphy comments, \"We would welcome a little less reticence about the historical background of Mary's life.\" Helen White writes in the Catholic Historical Review that \"perhaps the finest thing about Miss Coudenhove's study is her presentation of her heroine's spirit. . . . Miss Coudenhove reveals descriptive gifts of a very high order in the brilliant series of scenes through which she follows Mary Ward.\" A reviewer in Argentina praised G\u00f6rres's \"lively\" portrayal of Mary Ward. \n\n\n== Translations ==\nIn addition to English, G\u00f6rres's Mary Ward has been translated from German into Czech, Dutch, Hungarian, and Spanish:\n\nCzech: Velk\u00e1 hra Mary Wardov\u00e9 (2003), translated by Hana Fischerov\u00e1\nDutch: Mary Ward: een heldensage (1936), translated by Annie Salomons\nHungarian: Egy h\u0151si \u00e9let h\u0151si legend\u00e1ja: Ward M\u00e1ria (1938), translated by Thurz\u00f3 G\u00e1bor\nSpanish: Mar\u00eda Ward: una leyenda her\u00f3ica (1945), translated by Rosemarie Ortloff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Ida Friederike G\u00f6rres 1901-1971\".",

            "The Nature of Sanctity: A Dialogue by the Catholic author Ida Friederike Coudenhove is a book about holiness and what it means to be a saint. It explores this topic through the lens of the life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary. Coudenhove is more well known today by her married name, Ida Friederike G\u00f6rres.\nThe Nature of Sanctity was first published in English in 1932 by Sheed and Ward. It was translated from the German by Ruth Bonsall and Edward Ingram Watkin. This book was originally published in German in 1931 as Gespr\u00e4ch um die heilige Elisabeth. Ein Dialog \u00fcber die Heiligkeit.\nCatholic historian Christopher Dawson and T.F. Burns selected the short book The Nature of Sanctity to include as part of volume one, Essays on Religion and Culture, in the series The Persistence of Order. Essays on Religion and Culture was first published in 1932 by Sheed and Ward in London and then republished in 2019 by Cluny Media.\nThe English Dominican priest Gerald Vann, OP praised The Nature of Sanctity, writing that in Ida Coudenhove's \"essay, The Nature of Sanctity, the humanness of Christian holiness was magnificently stated.\"\nThe Nature of Sanctity, along with the book The Burden of Belief by Ida Coudenhove, inspired the book Dare to Live! Is Our Religion a Burden or a Boon? from 1941 by the American Carmelite priest Rev. Albert H. Dolan; Regarding his inspiration for Dare to Live!, Dolan describes The Nature of Sanctity and The Burden of Belief as \"magnificent volumes.\" Dare to Live! was republished in 2015 by Aeterna Press.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe Nature of Sanctity is written as a dialogue between two individuals identified as \"A\" and \"B.\" In this work, Coudenhove uses the life of St. Elizabeth of Hungary as the central topic of a debate about the nature of holiness as it relates to human nature, good deeds, sacrifice, and love for God and humankind. \u201cA\u201d argues that St. Elizabeth's human nature and sanctity were in conflict, and only by overcoming her humanness did she become a saint. \u201cB\u201d argues that St. Elizabeth's sanctity could only be made possible through the perfection of her human nature.The dialogue then explores whether St. Elizabeth and her husband Ludwig's marriage and access to wealth enabled or inhibited her path to holiness.\n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d argue whether sainthood is loving friendship with God, expressed through humility and sacrifice, and the nature of St. Elizabeth's banishment from Wartburg. Then, \u201cB\u201d argues that both Christians and non-Christians have a capacity for love of their neighbor, but that Christianity requires love of neighbor by all Christians. \u201cA\u201d responds that the gift of love of an individual hinders love of humankind. \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d then consider whether love of humanity, in the Christian sense, is actually love of God disguised as consideration for others. \u201cA\u201d concludes the dialogue by proposing that the saints\u2019 living witness to Christ's life is the greatest gift the saints offer to Christians.\n\n\n== Tetralogy ==\nThe Nature of Sanctity is part one of a four-part series G\u00f6rres wrote about key aspects of the Catholic faith and Catholic life. Part two is The Burden of Belief (published in German in 1932 and translated into English 1934). Part three is The Cloister and the World about discerning one's vocation in life (published in German in 1934 and translated into English 1935).[1] Part Four about mercy, which has not yet been translated into English, is Des Andern Last. Ein Gespr\u00e4ch \u00fcber die Barmherzigkeit (1940).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Nature of Sanctity was well received. In addition to being included in the series The Persistence of Order, as mentioned above, it received positive reviews. For example:\nIn Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, M.F.E. writes that, \u201cCoudenhove's rapid but searching analysis of the ideas of sacrifice, of self-denial, and of human and divine love will help many to understand the problem more truly and to catch a glimpse of the solution.\u201d In a review from 1934 in the Catholic magazine America, The Nature of Sanctity is described as \u201cstrong spiritual meat, and there is a deal of frank\u2013at times, maybe a bit too frank\u2013discussion; but this is needed badly if men and women of today are to be enticed at all to try to be saints.\u201d Agnus Dun in Anglican Theological Review writes that The Nature of Sanctity\u2019s \u201cvalue lies in its interpretation of the dominant motives and inner tensions of the radically ascetic life.\u201d\n\nAlso, The Nature of Sanctity received mention in The Times Literary Supplement of London in 1933, which wrote a short synopsis of the book.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nThe Nature of Sanctity was also translated from German into Dutch (1936), French (1936), and Hungarian (1936).\n\nDutch: Coudenhove, Ida Friederike.

            "Panzer greift an (known as Tank Attacks in English) is an unfinished book on armoured tactics and warfare by Erwin Rommel. It was to be the follow-up and companion work to his earlier and highly successful Infanterie greift an, which was published in 1937.\n\n\n== Manuscript ==\nPanzer greift an exists only in the form of scattered manuscripts and notes, but due to the fame of its author, it has achieved legendary status as a work of military literature. It is believed Rommel started writing the text while commandant of the War Academy at Wiener Neustadt (Theresian Military Academy) in 1938, though he may have started earlier during his time as an instructor at the Potsdam War Academy (1935\u201337). His career as a military theorist and instructor, however, was preempted by his duties as a commander and soldier during World War II.\nFollowing the end of the North African Campaign in 1943, he again started work on it, drawing upon his, by then, extensive experience and notes. But once more the war, along with ill health, interfered as he was put in charge of the entire Atlantic wall in 1944. After his staff car was strafed by an RCAF Spitfire fighter on 17 July that year, he again started on the work while recuperating from his injuries. However, he soon became implicated in the 20 July Plot against Adolf Hitler  and was compelled to commit suicide on 14 October 1944.\nFearful of the loss of Rommel's personal papers, then mostly stored in Wiener Neustadt, his wife and son collected and hid them from both the SS and advancing allied troops. According to Manfred Rommel, \"My father's death made my mother all the more anxious to save his papers, not only for personal reasons but so that, when history came to be written, the truth might be told.\" In the chaos at the end of the war, some papers were lost or went missing, but most of them eventually ended up in the hands of the US Army.\n\n\n== Publication ==\nMost of what was to be in the book can now be found in the 1953 book The Rommel Papers, which was developed from notes and diary entries by Rommel during the North African Campaign. The book was edited by the British journalist and historian B. H. Liddell Hart, with assistance of a former Wehrmacht general Fritz Bayerlein, who served on Rommel's staff in North Africa, and Rommel's widow and son. The volume contained an introduction and commentary by Liddell Hart.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nIn the film Patton, a book with this title is on the nightstand when he is awakened by his aides who inform him that Rommel is about to attack his army. When the tank battle is over, Patton exclaims \"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\"  This, of course, never could have occurred, as Rommel never completed his tank book; although Patton may very well have read Rommel's earlier book on infantry.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRommel myth\n\n\n== References ==",
            "The People of Kau is the title of the 1976 English-language translation of German film director Leni Riefenstahl's Die Nuba von Kau, an illustrated book, published in the same year in Germany. The book is a follow-up to her earlier successful 1973 photo book Die Nuba.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThis is a photographic monograph on the life of the people of Kau in the southern part of Sudan. Riefenstahl spent 16 weeks with the Nuba of Kau in 1975. These people, known as the \"South East Nuba\", live only 100 miles away from the Mesakin Nuba. Yet, they speak another language, follow different customs, and are said to be very different in character and temperament. Their knife-fights, dances of love and elaborately painted faces and bodies are represented in the book.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBetween 1962 and 1977, Riefenstahl had been photographing people of different Nuba ethnic groups in the southern part of Sudan on several visits. She was the first white female photographer who had obtained a special permission by the Sudanese government to do her research in the remote Nuba mountains of Sudan. She observed the Nuba's way of life and recorded it on film and in pictures. For some of her photographs and film scenes, she relied on Sudanese cameraman Gadalla Gubara, who accompanied her to the Nuba mountains.\nTogether with George Rodger's earlier photo essay on the Nuba and Latuka tribes, published in 1951 in National Geographic magazine, Riefenstahl's photographic documents are of anthropological, ethnological, and cultural-historical importance in relation to traditional life in the Nuba mountains of these times.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe most well-known critical reaction to Riefenstahl's photography of the Nuba came from the American intellectual, Susan Sontag. Sontag scrutinized the \"fascist aesthetics\" of these photo essays in her widely read essay \"Fascinating Fascism\". Writing in the New York Review of Books in 1975, she stated: \"The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets\".  She continued \"Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing.\" Sontag wrote that the collection was the \"final, necessary step in Riefenstahl's rehabilitation. It is the final rewrite of the past; or, for her partisans, the definitive confirmation that she was always a beauty-freak, rather than a horrid propagandist.\"\nAcademic studies, giving critical appraisals of Riefenstahl's books on the Nuba people, have been published by Alexandra Ludewig of the University of Western Australia and by anthropologist James C. Faris of the University of Connecticut. In his biography on Riefenstahl, the German media critic Rainer Rother gives a detailed account of her repeated visits to the Nuba people, comparing her approach to taking the photographs that seem to have started with a personal fascination of an African world, \"unspoilt by civilization\", up to her later carefully planned photo expeditions in order to further her fame as a photographer.\n\nAnother examination of both Riefenstahl's books and of James C. Faris's criticism was undertaken as a comment on a television film, called The Nuba from the BBC \u201cWorlds Apart\u201d ethnographic series. Here, the author John Ryle describes both the approach of the German photographer and of the anthropologist, trying to do justice to both. Also, he questions the attitude and moral judgements of the admirers of such \"exotic pictures from Africa\".We feel guilt at the pleasure we take in their beauty and their sensuality. One reason for this is because we know that it is, to a significant extent, the forces unleashed on the world by our own civilisation that are destroying such cultures, even as we celebrate them.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNuba\nGeorge Rodger\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGeorge Paul Meiu: Riefenstahl on Safari.

            "Praenumeration (German: Pr\u00e4numeration) was an early form of the subscription business model. It was a common business practice in the 18th century book trade in Germany. The publisher offered to sell a book that was planned but had not yet been printed, usually at a discount, so as to cover their costs in advance. The business practice was particularly common with magazines, helping to determine in advance how many subscribers there would be.\nFor example, when Johann Heinrich Zedler decided to issue a collection of works of Martin Luther he advertised that the book would be for sale through praenumeration at the Leipzig Easter Fair in 1728, with the first volume to be available at the following Michaelmas Fair in early October. \nWhen the eleventh and final volume was issued in 1733, Zedler found himself in difficulty. He had been using praenumeration payments for the future volumes to pay the bills for previous volumes, and now the last bills were due with no future payments to cover them.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCrowdfunding, 21st-century version\n\n\n== References ==",

Influential and long debated, the volume is often compared for its impact in its field with Charles Darwin's 1859 work, On the Origin of Species.\nFirst published as Geschichte Israels (\"History of Israel\") in 1878, the work had a second edition in 1883 under the title Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels.\nThe official English translation by J. Sutherland Black and Allan Menzies, with a preface by Wellhausen's friend and colleague the no less prominent British biblical scholar and orientalist William Robertson Smith, then came in 1885. Between the original publication and the translation, Wellhausen composed an 1881 article - originally called \"Jewish History\" but published as \"Israel\" - for Smith's ninth edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, a piece published repeatedly in English and in German.\nAlthough Wellhausen originally intended the Prolegomena as the first part of a two-volume work on the history of Israel and ancient Judaism, the second volume did not appear until 1894, as Israelitische und j\u00fcdische Geschichte.\n\n\n== Background ==\n(All references are to the Project Gutenberg e-text of Wellhausen's \"Prolegomena\")\nThe subject of the Prolegomena is the origins of the Pentateuch. It reviews all the major advances of the preceding century by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn, Wilhelm de Wette, Karl Heinrich Graf, Kuenen, Noldeke, Colenso and others, and puts forward the author's view, which is that the Priestly source was the last of the four sources, written during the Babylonian exile c.550 BC. The implication to be drawn from this was that the Mosaic Law contained in Leviticus, which is largely by the Priestly author, as well as the substantial amounts of material from the Priestly source to be found in Genesis, Exodus and the Book of Numbers, did not exist in the age of Joshua, Samuel, David and Solomon.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nThe book consists of an author's Introduction and three major sections. Its argument is that the ancient Israelites did not practice a religion recognisable as Judaism: the earliest religion of the Israelites, as depicted in the Yahwist and Elohist sources, was polytheistic and family-based. The middle layer, the Deuteronomist, shows a clear impulse to the centralisation of worship under the control of a dominant priesthood with royal support. Only in the final, post-Exilic, layer, the Priestly source, when the royal authority has vanished and the priesthood has assumed sole authority over the community, is there evidence of the religion that the world knows as Judaism.\n\n\n=== Introduction ===\nWellhausen announces his intention to demonstrate the hypothesis of Karl Heinrich Graf that the Law is later than the Prophets: that the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy (the torah, or \"law\", as they are known to the Jewish tradition and immediately precede the history of Israel making up the series from Joshua to Kings, the \"prophets\", called because they were thought to have been written by the prophet Samuel and others, but they were in fact written after those books). He then sets out some commonly agreed ground:\n\n1. The Pentateuch plus the book of Joshua make up a literary unit of six books, or Hexateuch, tracing the history of the Israelites from the Patriarchal age to the conquest of Canaan; and\n2. This hexateuch draws on three sources, the combined Yahwist/Elohist, which consists largely of narratives and dates from the period prior to the destruction of the kingdom of Israel (c.722 BC); the Deuteronomist, responsible for the book of Deuteronomy and dating from the reign of Josiah (c. 620 BC); and the Priestly source, made up largely of the law-code of Leviticus but with connections to all the other books except Deuteronomy.\nWellhausen proposes to fix the dates of each of the sources, especially of the Priestly source, \"by reference to an independent standard, namely, the inner development of the history of Israel so far as that is known to us by trustworthy testimonies, from independent sources.\"\n\n\n=== History of worship ===\nEach of the sources (Yahwist/Elohist, Deuteronomist and Priestly) reflects a different stage in evolution of religious practice in ancient Israel. Thus, to take one of the five elements of this practice, the Yahwist/Elohist \"sanctions a multiplicity of altars\", allowing sacrifice at any place; the Deuteronomist records the moment in history (the reform of Josiah, c.620 BC), when a single place of worship was demanded by both priesthood and king; and the Priestly law-code does not demand, but presupposes, centralised worship. In the same way, the other elements of ancient Israelite religion (sacrifice, sacred feasts, the position of the priests and Levites, and the \"endowment of the clergy\", tithes due to the priests and Levites) have a radically different form in the Yahwist/Elohist to that in the Priestly source, with Deuteronomy occupying an intermediate position. The Priestly source consistently attempts to disguise what are in fact innovations with a veneer of antiquity by inventing, for example, a fictional Tabernacle not mentioned anywhere in the oldest sources, to justify its insistence on centralised worship in Jerusalem. \"What is brought forward in Deuteronomy as an innovation is assumed in the Priestly Code to be an ancient custom dating as far back as to Noah.\"\n\n\n=== History of tradition ===\nThe history of the traditions of Israel, like the history of worship, shows a steady progression from the epic and prophetic age of the Yahwist and the Elohist, to the law-bound world of the Priestly source, with Deuteronomy acting as the bridge. \"In Chronicles the past is remodelled on the basis of the Law: transgressions take place now and then, but as exceptions from the rule. In the Books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, the fact of the radical difference of the old practice from the Law is not disputed [but] is simply condemned. In the Chronicles the pattern according to which the history of ancient Israel is represented is the Pentateuch, i.e. the Priestly Code.... [I]n the older historical books, the revision does not proceed upon the basis of the Priestly Code, which indeed is completely unknown to them, but on the basis of Deuteronomy. Thus in the question of the order of sequence of the two great bodies of laws, the history  of the tradition leads us to the same conclusion as the history of the cultus.\"\n\n\n=== Israel and Judaism ===\nIn his concluding section Wellhausen restates his argument that the Priestly source is the last to appear, postdating the Deuteronomist. He summarises also his further conclusions:\n\nThere was no written law in ancient Israel, the Torah being held as an oral tradition by priests and prophets.\nDeuteronomy was the first law and gained currency only during the Babylonian exile, when the prophetic tradition ceased.\nEzekiel and his successors were responsible for the codification and systematisation of worship and Ezra for the introduction of the Priestly code (the laws contained in Leviticus).\nIt was that creation of a written Torah which marked the break between the ancient history of Israel and the later history of Judaism.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nProlegomena zur Geschichte Israels, at Project Gutenberg\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nNicholson, Ernst (2002).

            "Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess is a biography of Rahel Varnhagen written by political philosopher Hannah Arendt. Originally her Habilitationsschrift she completed it in exile as a refugee, but was not published till 1957, in English, in the UK (London) by East and West Library.\n\n\n== History ==\nRahel Varnhagen was Arendt's habilitation thesis (Habilitationsschrift), largely written in the 1930s, but which she was unable to complete, having to flee Nazi Germany. She took the manuscript with her into exile in Paris, where she was able to complete it in 1938. Forced to flee once again, this time without her manuscript, she arrived in America in 1941. However, she had given a copy to Gershom Scholem, and it was finally published in 1957 having been translated from German.  The book was later translated into French in 1986, and Spanish in 2000. A revised edition in 1974 used the subtitle The Life of a Jewish Woman. A later biography of the subject by Heidi Thomann Tewarson (2001) distanced itself from Arendt's work, which its author considered too critical of Varnhagen. Arendt dedicated the book to her life-long friend Anne Mendelssohn, who had first drawn her attention to Varnhagen's writing.\n\n\n== Content ==\nRahel Varnhagen is ostensibly a biography of this nineteenth century Jewish socialite, and formed an important step in Arendt's analysis of Jewish history and the subjects of assimilation and emancipation, and introduced her treatment of the Jewish diaspora as either pariah or parvenu. In addition it represents an early version of her concept of history. Arendt's relation to Varnhagen permeates her subsequent work. Her examination of Varnhagen's life is set against the background of the catastrophic destruction of German-Jewish culture and its demonstrations of the illusion of any true German-Jewish \"symbiosis\" and the threatened existence of her subject. In this sense the book partially reflects Arendt's own view of herself as a German Jewish woman driven out of her own culture into a stateless existence. In this sense the work has been referred to as \"biography as autobiography\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Bibliographic notes ===",

The book strongly influenced the racial policy of the Nazi Party; Adolf Hitler was so impressed by the work that he made it the basis of his eugenics policy. The book had gone through six editions by 1926, and by 1945, more than half a million copies had been sold in Germany.\n\nIn the book, G\u00fcnther recognizes the Germans as being composed of five racial subtypes: Nordic, Mediterranean, Alpine, East Baltic, and Dinaric, viewing Nordics as being at the top of the racial hierarchy. He defines each racial subtype according to general physical appearance and their psychological qualities including their \"racial soul\" - referring to their emotional traits and religious beliefs, and provides detailed information on their hair, eye and skin colors and facial structure. He provides photographs of Germans identified as Nordic in places like Baden, Stuttgart, Salzburg, and Schwaben, and photographs of Germans he identifies as belonging to the Alpine and Mediterranean types, especially in Vorarlberg, Bavaria, and the Black Forest region of Baden.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRassenkunde des deutschen Volkes at Archive.org (various formats available)",

            "Spiritism (German: Der Spiritismus) is an 1885 book by German philosopher Eduard von Hartmann, the author of the famous treatise Philosophy of the Unconscious. In professor Corinna Treitel's opinion, publication of this book became one of the \"key events\" in history of the \"German occult movement.\" This book was \"one of the first works to attempt a complete psychological explanation of all occult phenomena.\" According to Charles Massey, one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research, publication of this book made the \"most brutal blow\" out of all ones that were ever directed against Spiritualism.\n\n\n== Contents of the book ==\nThe general state of the question.\nThe physical phenomena.\nThe ideality of the manifestations.\nTransfigurations and materialisations.\nThe spirit hypothesis.\n\n\n=== Spiritism and Spiritualism ===\nAt the beginning of the first chapter Hartmann explains that \"the word 'Spiritism' is of French production\", but the English and most part of the Germans prefer the term \"Spiritualism\". The author presents to use the term \"Spiritualism\" to denote the metaphysical point of view, which is the opposite of materialism, and the explanation of mediumistic phenomena through participation of \"spirits\", he offers to call by the term \"Spiritism\". He believes that most people, who are aspiring for Spiritism and read Spiritist journals, have no interest in a scientific study of the phenomena of mediumship, but instead seek \"the confirmation of their belief in immortality\". Hartmann considers a reopening of the huge field of phenomena, that were rejected in the Age of Enlightenment, as a great merit of the modern spiritistic movement. However, in his opinion, Spiritism threatens to become a public disaster in Germany, therefore the state should use its authority in order to interest scientists in a study of the spiritistic phenomena. He writes that the public has the complete right to know about these things, and since it is not able to formulate its own opinion, it only remains to wait for the conclusions drawn by the official representatives of science.\n\n\n=== Research methodology ===\nHartmann writes that in order to study the \"abnormal phenomena of human nature\" it is necessary to appeal to persons who are endowed with an abnormal organism. It should be remembered, he continues, that just as in \"experiments with an electrical friction machine\", there may be failures in experiments with mediums, but this should not prevent the \"investigation of abnormal phenomena.\" He believes that the scientific study of spiritism should be based on \"general methodological axioms\" which can not be \"transgressed with impunity.\"\n\n\"First, principles are not to be multiplied without necessity; thus a second sort of causes are not to be supposed, as long as a single sort will suffice. Secondly, we should as long as possible abide by causes whose existence is guaranteed by experience or indubitable inference, and should not unnecessarily catch at causes of doubtful or unproven existence, such as are to be first established by their value as hypothesis for the explanation of phenomena in question. Thirdly, we should as long as possible try to do with natural causes and not touch supernatural ones without urgent necessity. Against these three axioms Spiritism offends.\"\n\n\n=== Hypothesis of hallucinations ===\nThe study of \"masked somnambulism,\" as Hartmann argues, can give an understanding of the \"whole area\" of mediumistic phenomena. He explains that a \"universal medium must be more than autosomnambule; he must be at the same time a powerful magnetiser.\" In his opinion, on a spiritistic s\u00e9ance medium plunges itself into a state of \"masked or open somnambulism.\" Further, such a medium-autosomnambule has hallucinations, considered by him for reality, and at the same time, he possesses a strong desire that those present should see this imaginary reality, i.e. would have the same hallucinatory ideas as he himself.\nHartmann believes that \"from the scientific psychological standpoint\" every participator of mediumistic s\u00e9ance must constantly think on himself that he is under the influence of a very powerful mesmerist who aims to immerse him in masked somnambulism and thus taint him with his hallucinations.\n\n\"The mediums in their state of masked or open somnambulism have a size of nerve force, be it self-produced or extracted and accumulated by those present, as no magnetiser in his waking state has made it unfold, so surely theirs ability must with the help of this superior quantity of force to put those present in a state of open or masked somnambulism, greater than that of any magnetiser acting in the awake state.\"\nAccording to Hartmann, the waking will of the medium in the somnambulic state fulfills the function of a magnetiser, giving the somnambulic consciousness a certain direction in relation to emerging hallucinations. If a medium \"has the hallucination\" of no longer being itself but of being the \"spirit of Katie King,\" for example, and of appearing as such, the hallucination will also be transmitted to the recipients, that the medium who emerges from the curtain really is \"Katie King.\" He believes that materialisation is most often just a transfiguration of medium himself, because when the phantom was separating from the medium it always appeared that it was completely coming from the medium and returning to him.\nThe hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann rejects the possibility of obtaining photographs on which both the medium and the materialised figure would be simultaneously placed, since hallucination can not be photographed, thus, in the opinion of its author, all such photographs are fake. For example, about a photograph taken by William Crookes, on which can be seen the medium simultaneously with the phantom, Hartmann writes that it is exposed to the strong suspicion that \"instead of the supposed phantom the medium, and instead of the supposed medium the dress of the medium, stuffed with a cushion in a half-concealed position, have been photographed.\"\n\n\n=== Hypothesis of nerve force ===\nAccording to Hartmann, any physical phenomena of mediumship, regardless of their complexity, are always fulfilled due to \"mediumistic nerve force,\" which is nothing else than a physical force that is \"produced\" by medium's nervous system and passes unhindered through any substance, \"like magnetism.\" The medium's will must direct this force and control the one, and the distribution of the one depends on the \"fantastic image that is in the somnambulistic conscious of the medium.\" In addition, physical phenomena that require \"a special strain of nerve force\" are occurring when mediums sink into \"an open somnambulism.\" The author confirms that the imprints of organic forms belong to \"the most striking phenomena\" of mediumship\u2014they had been surpassed only cases of \"matter's penetration through matter.\" He admits that the imprints undoubtedly prove that in this case there is no transfer of hallucinations but \"an objective-real impact of mediumistic force on matter,\" and explains this phenomenon as follows:\n\n\"If we imagine another arrangement of the pressure and tension lines of the mediumistic nerve force\u2014an arrangement corresponding to those pressures that are produced by inner side of the flat laying hand on a soft substance capable of perceiving the imprint, then the movement of the particles of matter caused by such a dynamical system should again be consistent with that, which is caused by direct pressure of the hand, i.e. imprint of an organic form would have been obtained, although such a form, capable of producing such imprint, might not has been in material kind.\"\nSome of the phenomena Hartmann explains by the fact that medium in a state of somnambulism allegedly combines \"the hallucination of the emerging image\" with the idea on the need to move a real object and unconsciously produces this displacement \"with the help of his mediumistic nerve force,\" while remaining confident that it was performed by own force of the fantastic image that has appeared by him, that is, through the \"transfer of his hallucination to the audience,\" he unconsciously inspires them with the idea that the displacement that occurred really was fulfilled by that ghost which is just his hallucination.\n\n\n=== Mental manifestations ===\nRegarding spiritistic messages, Hartmann argues that only \"the somnambulistic consciousness\" can be the source of their content. He writes, \"All messages have a content corresponding to the mental level and views of the medium.\" As a rule, this level happens to be \"below the spiritual level\" of the medium and participants of the s\u00e9ance, less often it equals, but it happens to be never higher.\nThe author writes that some mediums, with their \"mimic transfigurations\", exhibit striking linguistic abilities. They can reproduce words and phrases \"in strange, incomprehensible dialects\", which they had previously accidentally heard without paying attention to this. According to Hartmann, only a medium, who can write, can \"produce automatic writing or perform writing at a distance [without the involvement of the hand].\"\n\n\n=== Explanation of paranormal ===\nIn principle, Hartmann admits the possibility of a mediumistic phenomenon of \"the penetration of matter\", as well as allows for the possibility of all other phenomena confirmed by the testimony of witnesses. However, he opposes the hypothesis by German astronomer Z\u00f6llner about the fourth dimension of space, preferring, rather,  the statement \"on the molecular shakes of material bonds in the body, than the one on movements and vibrations outside of three-dimensional space.\" According to Hartmann, neither the sack nor the cage in which the medium can be contained will not be a hindrance to him: if he can pass through a substance in a state of sleep, \"nothing prevents him from appearing as a phenomenon in front of the audience, in spite of all these precautions.\"\nAfter the mentioning to the \"expansive action\" of the mediumistic nerve force that overcomes the \"cohesion of material particles\" and leads to acoustic phenomena, Hartmann proceeds to spiritistic phenomena related to \"penetration of matter\", classifying them as \"an especially incredible field of phenomena.\" He refers to the confirmed experiments of Z\u00f6llner and the facts of \"a transference\" of objects into a locked room, which repeatedly observed under the most stringent conditions of control. He lists various types of \"the penetration of matter\": the passing an iron ring through the hand of a medium, penetration of coins, slate-pencils, etc. in completely closed boxes, the inserting a ring on the table's leg, the tying of knots on ropes and belts with \"sealed\" ends, the bringing into the s\u00e9ance's room the items from another room or other houses, as well as bringing of flowers which were growing outside the room.\nAccording to Hartmann, medium can't by only his will or by his purely psychological influence, cause the above-mentioned physical phenomena in inanimate objects. The main action of the will is a release the \"mediumistic nerve force\" out the nervous system and its directing with a certain way on the living or dead objects. Nevertheless, according to him, in the study of any phenomena of mediumism, with the exception of clairvoyance, there is no need to go \"beyond the bounds of the natural explanations.\"\n\n\n=== On hypothesis of spirits ===\nIn conclusion, Hartmann assesses the central idea of spiritism:\n\n\"Thus the whole hypothesis of spirits has dissolved into pure nothingness, after first the direct physical power, then the production of the phenomena of materialisation, and finally production of the ideality of the manifestations, have shifted from the presupposed spirits to the mediums. Whether there are spirits or not, we do not have to examine here; in any case, if there are any, they are referred back to that other world from which Spiritualism believed them to have sunk into this world.\"\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nOne of the most active critics of Hartmann's book was Alexander Aksakov. The proofs which Aksakov used to \"disprove Hartmann's hallucination hypothesis\" were the photographs of spirits. The pictures \"taken during the s\u00e9ances, in which both the medium and the materialised form were visible,\" were convincingly demonstrating, according to Aksakov, that materialisation is \"an objective phenomenon\", and not a kind the mass hypnosis (see the photo on the left). Criticism by Aksakov was supported in the publications of occultists in the journal Sphinx, where \"Hartmann was portrayed variously as obtuse or dishonest for his refusal to recognise his logical errors.\" Aksakov has been emphasizing that Hartmann had no practical experience and did not pay enough attention to those facts that did not correspond to his convictions, and many phenomena were \"completely unknown\" to him.\n\nProfessor Alfred Lehmann wrote that Hartmann uses his hypotheses, according to how it is more convenient to him: if a materialised figure appears on s\u00e9ance, then for him it is just a hallucination imagined by the participators of the s\u00e9ance; if this phantom is displayed in the photo, then its appearance is explained by the action of the mediumistic nerve force, since otherwise it could not be photographed. But the view arbitrarily using such unstable explanations is \"scientifically untenable.\" Commenting on Hartmann's statement that imprints of the organic forms are produced by the mediumistic nerve force, Aksakov wrote that this hypothesis necessarily leads to \"the acceptance of the length, thickness, and density\" of this force, in other words, to that which usually serves to define the body, thus such imprints should be produced \"by the action of an invisible body formed with help of the medium,\" that is, by the materialised form. Hartmann also speaks that mediumistic nerve force \"can cause thermal and light phenomena,\" for example, it can produce certain forms, \"at least inorganic ones: crosses, stars, a bright field with light points shimmering on it.\" Hence, here, according to Aksakov's commentary, the nerve force becomes visible and does not constitute a hallucination. Why then does the same force that has become visible in a materialized organic image, sometimes in a luminous one, turns into a hallucination? According to Aksakov, the hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann is destroyed \"by his own logic.\"\nIn connection with the hypothesis of the author, explaining the physical phenomena of mediumship, Massey noted that \"the opinion of most persons conversant with them will be that Hartmann's hypothesis is too complicated in itself, and even thus is unadequate to the facts.\" Karl Du Prel brought such Hartmann's statement from the first chapter of his book: \"Since I never attended a s\u00e9ance myself, I am not in a condition to form a judgment on the reality of the phenomena in question... On the other hand, I hold myself at any rate competent to offer a conditional judgment on the conclusions to be drawn from these phenomena in case of their reality, for this is peculiarly the office of the philosopher.\" Then he commented on this passage as follows:\n\n\"I must admit, I always believed that there is 'a golden rule for the philosopher'\u2014to remain silent where he has no experience, so that no one could be told: 'Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!' (If you had been silent, you would have remained a philosopher!) That is why my final verdict lies in the fact that Hartmann, with his writings against spiritism, has certainly contributed to eristic but not in philosophy.\"\n\n\n== Interesting facts ==\nA Russian translation of the book was performed by the famous chemist Alexander Butlerov.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nDer Spiritismus [Spiritism] (in German).

            "Der Struwwelpeter (\"shock-headed Peter\") is an 1845 German children's book written and illustrated by Heinrich Hoffmann. It comprises ten illustrated and rhymed stories, mostly about children. Each cautionary tale has a clear moral lesson that demonstrates the disastrous consequences of misbehavior in an exaggerated way. The title of the first story provides the title of the whole book. Der Struwwelpeter is one of the earliest books for children that combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format, and is considered a precursor to comic books.\nDer Struwwelpeter is known for introducing the villainous character of the Tailor (or Scissorman) to Western literature. Some researchers now see the stories in the book as illustrations of modern child mental disorders.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nHoffmann wrote the book that would later be titled Struwwelpeter in reaction to what he perceived as a lack of good books for children. Intending to buy a picture book as a Christmas present for his three-year-old son, Hoffmann instead wrote and illustrated his own book. At the time of producing it, Hoffmann had no intentions of publishing his book.\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nThe first appearance of Hoffmann's book outside his immediate family circle was in a meeting organized by Frankfurt literary club Tutti Frutti Society (Gesellschaft der Tutti-Frutti) on 18 January 1845. On the evening of that day, Zacharias L\u00f6wenthal, a co-founder of publishing company Literarische Anstalt, bought Hoffmann's book for 80 gulden. Hoffmann later wrote that \"[in] that night, at 11 o'clock, I had, almost without knowing what I had done, suddenly become an author of juvenile books.\"\nThe book first appeared in the Frankfurt marketplace in October of that year under the title Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder mit 15 sch\u00f6n kolorierten Tafeln f\u00fcr Kinder von 3\u20136 Jahren (\"funny stories and droll pictures with 15 beautifully coloured panels for children of 3\u20136 years\"). The first version had its illustrations printed with lithographic plates and colored by hand with stencils, the text was printed using typesetting. On 3 October, the book was advertised in the B\u00f6rsenblatt for a retail price of 48 kreuzer.\nIn 1846, three other editions of the book were published. The second edition had 5,000 copies produced, each of which was priced at 57 kreuzer; Hoffmann's royalty was of 6.25 percent per copy. Hoffmann's name was only partially revealed in the second edition, where he used the pseudonym \"Hoffmann Kinderslieb\". His authorship of the book was, however, fully revealed to the public in an advertisement featured on a Frankfurter Konversationsblatt publication on 11 December 1846. Hoffmann's real name was only fully displayed in the fifth edition, which was published in 1847.\nThe third edition was the first to be officially titled Struwwelpeter, though the second edition had already been nicknamed as such by some book reviewers.\n\n\n=== English editions ===\nThe titles Struwelpeter and Strewelpeter have been used in multiple English editions of Struwwelpeter. The name Slovenly Peter was first found in an 1849 American version of the book.\nBritish twin illustrators Janet and Anne Grahame Johnstone provided new illustrations for an English translation published in 1950.\n\n\n=== Copyright issues ===\nIn 1847, Struwwelpeter's publishing house sued a Nuremberg publisher for printing the book on broadsheets.\nIn 1851, the same organization sued publisher Christian Scholz on grounds that he had plagiarized Struwwelpeter by publishing translations of the book in English, Dutch and Swedish. Scholz lost the case and was sentenced to pay a fine of 1,040 gulden, along with court costs of 127 gulden. He was also ordered to destroy all lithographic plates and unsold books in his inventory. This became one of the first copyright court cases in Germany.\nIn 1891 Mark Twain wrote his own translation of the book, but because of copyright issues Twain's Slovenly Peter was not published until 1935, 25 years after his death.\n\n\n== The stories ==\n\nStruwwelpeter describes a boy who does not groom himself properly and is consequently unpopular.\nDie Geschichte vom b\u00f6sen Friederich (\"The Story of Wicked Frederick\"): A violent boy terrorizes animals and people. Eventually he is bitten by a dog, who goes on to eat the boy's food while Frederick is bedridden.\nDie gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug (\"The Very Sad Tale with the Matches\"): A girl plays with matches, accidentally ignites herself and burns to death. Only her cats mourn her.\nDie Geschichte von den schwarzen Buben (\"The Story of the Inky Boys\"): Nikolas (or \"Agrippa\" in some translations) catches three boys teasing a dark-skinned boy. To teach them a lesson, he dips them in black ink.\nDie Geschichte von dem wilden J\u00e4ger (\"The Story of the Wild Huntsman\") is the only story not primarily focused on children. In it, a hare steals a hunter's musket and eyeglasses and begins to hunt the hunter. In the ensuing chaos, the hare's child is burned by hot coffee and the hunter jumps into a well.\nDie Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher (\"The Story of the Thumb-Sucker\"): A mother warns her son Konrad not to suck his thumbs. However, when she goes out of the house he resumes his thumb-sucking, until a roving tailor appears and cuts off his thumbs with giant scissors.\nDie Geschichte vom Suppen-Kaspar (\"The Story of Soup-Kaspar\") begins as Kaspar (or \"Augustus\" in some translations), a healthy, strong boy, proclaims that he will no longer eat his soup. Over the next five days, he wastes away and dies. The last illustration shown is of his grave, which has a soup tureen atop it.\nDie Geschichte vom Zappel-Philipp (\"The Story of Fidgety Philip\"): A boy who won't sit still at dinner accidentally knocks all of the food onto the floor, to his parents' great displeasure.\nDie Geschichte von Hans Guck-in-die-Luft (\"The Story of Johnny Look-In-The-Air\") concerns a boy who habitually fails to watch where he is walking. One day he walks into a river; he is soon rescued, but his briefcase drifts away.\nDie Geschichte vom fliegenden Robert (\"The Story of Flying Robert\"): A boy goes outside during a storm. The wind catches his umbrella and lifts him high into the air, with the boy sailing into the distance.\n\n\n== Music, film, and stage adaptations ==\n\nA British stage production of Shockheaded Peter, by Philip Carr and Nigel Playfair, with music by Walter Rubens, premiered at the Garrick Theatre in London on 26 December 1900, and played 41 performances. The title role was played by George Grossmith Jr., with Kate Bishop as Mamma and Kitty Loftus as Harriet. The piece returned to the Garrick the following year, again playing 41 performances from 14 December, this time with Lawrence Grossmith as Peter, Nina Boucicault as Harriet and 11-year-old Marie Lohr as \"Child\". In a revival at the Wimbledon Theatre in South London from 26 December 1929 Mamma was played in a limited run of matinees by Louie Pounds, with H. Scott Russell as Papa, Leslie Holland as Augustus and Rex London as Peter.\nGeoffrey Shaw's Struwelpeter, produced in 1914, featured the song \"Conrad Suck-a-Thumb\" by Martin Shaw.\nA ballet of Der Struwwelpeter with music composed by Norbert Schultze was produced in Germany before World War II.\nA live action film based on the book was released in Germany in 1955. Directed by Fritz Genschow, in this adaptation there is a \"happy\" ending where the characters' bad deeds are reversed.\nLittle Suck-a-Thumb (1992) is a psychoanalytical interpretation of the infamous cautionary tale. The short film by writer/director David Kaplan stars Cork Hubbert and Evelyn Solann, with Jim Hilbert as the Great Tall Scissorman.\n\"The Misadventures of Struwwelpeter\" for tenor and piano (also orchestrated for chamber ensemble) was composed by Michael Schelle in 1991. Five of the stories are included in the original version with piano.  \"Inky Boys\" is included only in the chamber version.\nStruwwelpeterlieder (1996) is a setting of three of the stories for soprano, viola and piano by American composer Lowell Liebermann.\nGerman composer Kurt Hessenberg (a descendant of Hoffmann) arranged Der Struwwelpeter for children's choir (op. 49) later in his life.\nShockheaded Peter (1998) is a British musical by The Tiger Lillies. that combines elements of pantomime and puppetry with musical versions of the poems with the songs generally following the text. It won a number of British theatre awards in the years following its release.\nComposer Kenneth Hesketh's 2000\u20132001 work, Netsuke (from the Japanese miniature sculptures called netsuke) comprises five short movements inspired variously by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Le Petit Prince, Struwwelpeter, and a poem by Walter de la Mare.\n\n\n== Comics adaptations ==\nGerman comics artist David F\u00fcleki has created a number of manga-style adaptions of Struwwelpeter:\n\nStruwwelpeter: Die R\u00fcckkehr (2009, Tokyopop)\nStruwwelpeter: Das gro\u00dfe Buch der St\u00f6renfriede (2009, Tokyopop)\nStruwwelpeter in Japan (Free Comic Book Day comic; 2012, Delfinium Prints)\nThe Scissorman story is adapted into comics form by Sanya Glisic in The Graphic Canon, Volume 2, published in 2012.\n\n\n== Media influences ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nEnglish author Edward Harold Begbie's first published book, The Political Struwwelpeter (1898), is of British politics, with the British Lion is as Struwwelpeter, \"bedraggled, with long, uncut claws.\"\nW.

His mother had given him the book as a child and the stories gave him nightmares. Rix wanted to create a similar series of books for his children's generation.\nDer Fall Struwwelpeter (\"The Struwwelpeter Case\"), 1989, by J\u00f6rg M. G\u00fcnther is a satirical treatment in which the various misdeeds in the story - both by the protagonists and their surroundings - are analyzed via the regulations of the German Strafgesetzbuch.\nThe Jasper Fforde fantasy/mystery novel The Fourth Bear (Hodder & Stoughton, 2006) opens with a police sting operation by the Nursery Crime Division to arrest the Scissorman.\n\n\n=== Comics ===\n\nGerman cartoonist F.

            "Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils (German: The Taboo of Homosexuality: The History of a Prejudice) is a standard work of Germanophone research into homophobia, written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, and first published in 1978.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBleibtreu-Ehrenberg used the better part of the 1970s in order to complete Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils (reprinted in 1981, then leaving out the word Tabu from its title) as beside drawing from scholars such as Mircea Eliade, Marija Gimbutas, and Michel Foucault, she conducted sociological research on homophobia and homosexuality, and translated previously unavailable or neglected artifacts and records from dead languages for the first time.\n\n\n== Authority ==\nTabu Homosexualit\u00e4t is considered a foundational standard work in Germanophone research into homophobia, misogyny, patriarchy, general repression of sensuality and particularly repression of sexual deviance (Leibfeindlichkeit). As recently as 2007, the Berlin Department of Education (Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung) officially recommended use of the book in high schools as part of homophobia awareness trainings in social studies classes.\nIn spite of not having been translated into any other language as of 2008, since its first publication Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t remains treated and quoted as a standard source internationally as well. As of 2008, it is found in a number of Western European libraries, and in the US is even available in libraries in 13 different states.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Introducing chapters ===\nIn the prefacing Einf\u00fchrung, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.\nIn order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, Alte Nachrichten \u00fcber die ethische Bewertung der m\u00e4nnlichen Homosexualit\u00e4t bei germanischen St\u00e4mmen (\"Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes\"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong numinous taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative in themselves.\nOnly three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher Sextus Empiricus in the third volume of his Outlines of Pyrrhonism mentioned a tribe of Karmans among whom \"lewdness between men [...], as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing\". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhetoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by Posidonius, quoted in Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, on Celtic sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.\nThe third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames (\"cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted\") by proto-historic Germanics as mentioned by Tacitus in his Germania, whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.\n\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural background: The Three Strata of Indo-European society ===\nAccording to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.\nIts roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural strata (see stratification (archeology), social stratification, and archaeological horizon) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:\n\nThe Stone Age Subarctic Shamanic Culture of the last glacial period (called W\u00fcrm regarding the Alps region, Weichsel regarding Scandinavia, and Devensian regarding the British Isles) ending c. 9,000 BCE,\nthe Maternal Megalith Culture of European and Middle East Bronze Age, introducing farming and practicing fertility cults including sexual rites (c. 9.000 BCE to c. 3.000 BCE; roughly equivalent to Gimbutas's \"Old Europe\"),\nand the violent West-bound conquest of these regions by belligerent Proto-Indo-European tribes from Asia (see Bronze Age collapse, Kurgan hypothesis, and \u00c6sir-Vanir War#Theories), beginning around the end of the fourth millennium BCE, introducing domestication of animals (particularly horses for purposes of work, mobility, and especially warfare) and cattle breeding, and initiating the Indo-European Iron Age in Europe and the Middle East.\nSee also Three-age system. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the trifunctional hypothesis by Georges Dum\u00e9zil, of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dum\u00e9zil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the Kurgan hypothesis and what Gimbutas saw as \"Old Europe\", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See Proto-Indo-European society for details.\nThe immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual Maternal Megalith Culture in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting religious stratification emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized Maternal Megalith Culture and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility Vanir and belligerent, patriarchal \u00c6sir religion, with the mythological \u00c6sir-Vanir War as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of The Rape of the Sabine Women in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.\n\n\n=== Subsequent derivations within Indo-European societies ===\nFrom there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:\n\nChapter IV, Interdependenzen zwischen religi\u00f6sen Werten und sozialen Normen bei den Germanen (\"Interdependencies between religious values and social norms in Germanic culture\"): Within subsequently dominant Indo-European culture, the originally highly regarded Shamanic priest of the subdued and marginalized Maternal Megalith Culture was ethnocentrically re-interpreted as an evil figure, and the former fertility rites as evil lewd magic. The least rationalized version of the resultant negative archetype of a lewd, non-human freak as apparent in sufficiently surviving artifacts and records is to be found in Norse sources, as the mythological, demonic nithing creature. Due to this lack of rationalization of the archetype's Norse version, it is the most pure, primordial version available to modern research, and the attributes of the nithing are thus the most easily identifiable among all the archetype's local variations as a negative ethnocentric, mythological re-interpretation of the Maternal Megalith Culture stratum under the circumstances of Indo-European cultural dominance. As explained in further chapters, this socio-cultural archetype of an evil, lewd non-human freak became a profound influence for every aspect about ubiquitous Leibfeindlichkeit (repression of sensuality) that followed from it in Western civilization.\nChapter V, Tendenzen der Beurteilung homosexuellen Verhaltens von der Christianisierung bis zum Beginn der Ketzer- und Hexenverfolgungen (\"Tendencies in evaluation of homosexual behaviour between Christianisation and the beginning inquisitorial persecution of witches and heretics\"), section 1, Die r\u00f6mische Gesetzgebung (\"Roman laws\"): Capital homophobic tendencies in Ancient Rome as apparent for instance in Lex Scantinia (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not cover Ancient Greece in depth until her 1990 book Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt, only emphasizing in Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t and later works that ancient Greek pederasty does not meet her primary focus for Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t of same-sex activities among adult males, as in Ancient Greece, these relations took place between fertile and infertile individuals, by quoting, among other modern scholars and ancient sources, Kenneth Dover).\nChapter V, section 2, Die kirchlichen Bestimmungen (\"Ecclesiastical regulations\"): Homophobia apparent in the ancient Jewish culture (Leviticus 18) and in Early Christianity (Saint Paul, early Church Fathers, and penitentials) up to the ninth century CE. Here, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg debunks the Biblical origin of the common Sodom myth created by Byzantine emperor Justinian I in the 500s CE who was the first person in the world to claim that Genesis 19 would in any way relate to same-sex activities.\nChapter V, section 3, Die gef\u00e4lschten Kapitulare des Benedictus Levita (\"The forged capitularies of Benedictus Levita\"): The Medieval ecclesiastical concept of sodomy brought forth by the forged Capitularia Benedicti Levitae within Pseudo-Isidore (a collection of persuasive false material on theological, legal, and political matters fabricated by Frankish monks around 850 CE). During proto-historic Iron Age, the religious fertility rites of the marginalized Maternal Megalith Culture stratum had been ethnocentrically interpreted as the evil, lewd seid magic of a nithing in proto-historic Norse and Germanic sources. Referencing Justinian's Sodom myth, Frankish monk Benedictus Levita as the author of the Capitularia Benedicti Levitae obviously appealed to these prevailing folk beliefs when he strongly associated his idea of sodomy with evil sorcery, satanism, heathenism, and heresy. Thereby, he also originally incorporated the common Germanic practice of burning nithings into ecclesiastical law as burning sodomites and witches alike at the stake. Prior to Levita, church dogma had denounced belief in witches and burning people out of these pagan beliefs as sinful.\nChapter VI, Die P\u00f6nalisierung der Homosexualit\u00e4t im Rahmen der Ketzer- und Hexenprozesse des Mittelalters (\"The penalisation of homosexuality within the Medieval heresy and witch trials\"): How Levita's ideas were put into practice by creating the Inquisition. Also discusses in-depth the Malleus Maleficarum as an extension and further popularization of Levita's original ideas on sodomites and witches.\nChapter VII, Weiterentwicklung und Modifizierung des Vorurteils gegen die Homosexualit\u00e4t bis 1870 (\"Further developments and modifications of homophobic prejudice up until 1870\"): Arriving at the theories of pathology (Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg specifically mentions the concept of moral insanity), corruption, and downfall of the state brought fourth by the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment, the history of these pseudo-scientific ideologies, and how they were instrumental in prolonging the traditional persecution of sexual deviants, especially homosexuals, in the Western world from the 17th to the 20th century.\nChapter VIII, Beeintr\u00e4chtigung der Erforschung des Vorurteils gegen\u00fcber der m\u00e4nnlichen Homosexualit\u00e4t durch das Vorurteil selbst (\"Obliteration of research into homophobic prejudice caused by the very prejudice itself\"): Socio-psychological analyses of patterns and social dynamics of general and specifically homophobic prejudice and discrimination in Western society, building upon the facts, patterns, and concepts demonstrated in earlier chapters, emphasizing again the cultural impact and significance of Indo-European influence and the Three Strata of Western culture in general. In further detail than in this one chapter, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg would re-visit this academic field of general Vorurteilsforschung (prejudice studies) in her later work Angst und Vorurteil (1989), in-depth analyzing in full the common patterns of prejudice and discrimination in modern Western society following from the cultural evolution described in Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t.\n\n\n=== Relations to other works, by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg and others ===\nIn Mannbarkeitsriten (1980) and Angst und Vorurteil (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western colonialism when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the Age of Discovery and Age of Conquests on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of syphilis through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.\nThese processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over \"uncivilized\", sensual, and \"filthy\" \"savages\" (see for instance the saying of the White man's burden of being morally obliged to \"civilize\" non-Westerners), social and ethnic \"aliens\", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t, Mannbarkeitsriten, and Angst und Vorurteil) Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization, Critical Theory's Dialectic of Enlightenment and The Authoritarian Personality, or The Civilizing Process by Norbert Elias.\nFinally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in Angst und Vorurteil, just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the scientific Enlightenment approach to sexuality, the impact of HIV corrupted post-WWII progressive counterculture's influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.\n\n\n== Editions ==\n1978: Tabu Homosexualit\u00e4t: Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils, S.

            "Von Stahel und Eysen (English: On Steel and Iron) is the first printed book on metallurgy, published in 1532 by several publishers: Kunegunde Hergot in Nuremberg, Melchior Sachs in Erfurt, and Peter Jordan in Mainz. It has been suggested that Hergot was probably the first to publish the text, as the material seems to come from Nuremberg: its material on tempering and quenching is similar to the short treatise on hardening iron beginning 'Von dem herten. Nu spricht meister Alkaym' in the late fourteenth- or early fifteenth-century Nuremberg manuscript N\u00fcrnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a.\nAbout half the text is on how to harden iron and steel through tempering and quenching, mentioning water, but also a range of recipes of varying degrees of elaborateness. The recipe 'take clarified honey, fresh urine of a he-goat, alum, borax, olive oil, and salt; mix everything well together and quench therein' might, through the urea content of the urine (H2NCONH2), have helped to produce nitrated, 'case-hardened' iron. Less likely to have been efficacious is: 'take varnish, dragon's blood, horn scrapings, half as much salt, juice made from earthworms, radish juice, tallow, and vervain and quench therein. It is also very advantageous in hardening if a piece that is to be hardened is first thoroughly cleaned and well polished'.\nA modern commentator on some of the more outlandish techniques in the book noted: \"There isn't really much to say...except that perhaps it was meant to trip up rivals. However, this may not be the case because similar instructions were circulated in 1708 in Nuremberg.\"\nThe text also includes techniques for colouring, soldering, and etching. Etching was quite a new technology at the time, and Von Stahel und Eysen provides the first attested recipes.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nWilliams, H.

            "The Fortunes of Miss Follen is a romance novel by American author H. B. Goodwin, using the pen name, \"Mrs. Goodwin-Talcott\". It was published in 1876 by D. Appleton & Company of New York City. The book depicts German country life and manners, with vivid descriptions of the Rhineland and of English scenery, as well as a realistic word-picture of the Oberammergau Passion Play.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nGoodwin wrote under various pen names. The Fortunes of Miss Follen (New York, D. Appleton & Company, 1876; 12mo, cloth, pp. 270. Price $1.50) was the only instance when she used \"Mrs. Goodwin-Talcott\". Most of the reviews were favorable, but the one issued by The New York Times was quite negative. When the novel's new edition was published five years later, this time by A. Williams & Co. of Boston, a new title was used, Christine's fortune, and the author was credited as \"Mrs. H. B. Goodwin\", a name she had used before and after publishing The Fortunes of Miss Follen.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe story opens with a description of Baden and its curious market. The heroine makes her appearance as a young and delicate market-girl, presiding over a table of dainty laces or needle work, the results of her own toil. She is the daughter of a frugal couple who cultivate a small dairy farm on the hillside. She has a male friend in the schoolmaster also, who later on would be nearer if he could, and who meanwhile with his books and talk feeds her growing culture with music and knowledge of art and of the great world outside the valley. She is an apt scholar. An early and happy love fades into a consuming grief; but an American gentleman and his wife become interested in her sweet face and pure character, and her elevation begins. They teach her English, and then employ her to teach their young daughter, Bessie, the German language. Presently, Colonel Ranney appears, a retired English army officer who wants a governess for his two little daughters, and Christine has got far enough along to prove just the one.  \nThe story of her blossoming out in beauty both of person and character as these changes successively come to her, is told very deftly and vividly, and in a style remarkable for its purity and its artistic use of the imagination. She is a sort of Undine, born not indeed of the waves, but of the vine-clad soil, and carrying with her everywhere the freshness and innocence of nature. None of these uplifting stages seem to be at all foreign to her, and after seeing her graceful motions and hearing her sing at her spinning wheel on her mother's porch, we feel that she has a soul within her, however she came by it, that is capable of everything which is attributed to her afterwards.  \nThe story flows gently on, with a plot so transparent that few readers can be long in doubt whether Christine will finally share the fortunes of Conrad Kleist the schoolmaster, or of Colonel Ranney himself; and even the happy escape of little Alice, half thrilling and wholly natural as it is, could be hardly necessary in order to draw the meshes of love closer around the Colonel's heart. He is in deep enough already. The Colonel, too, is an admirable character himself. And after he is happily located on the ancestral acres with Christine for the central light of his home, we can imagine his and her plans for the benefit of the tenantry around them. That is what they are about now, doubtless; for this picture is too realistic not to have its counterpart in the home of many an English country gentleman of the better class. \n\n\n== Major characters ==\nChristine Follen, the heroine, is a German peasant girl who is born with a beauty which gradually lifts her into refined life. She has three lovers in succession, a miller's son, the schoolmaster, and the English gentleman, who finally, in defiance of his family, marries her. His fine estate is the least of his merits.\nLudwig, the miller's son\nConrad Kleist, the German schoolmaster\nHerr Vassar, an American\nColonel Ranney, an Englishman in the British Army, with no special ambitions, but with a thorough-going disposition to do the right thing when he knows it\n\n\n== Themes ==\nChristian sentiment abounds in the book.\n\n\n== Style and genre ==\nThe novel is remarkable for its sweet, placid tone and for the absence of that introspective manner and that disposition to satire which had been somewhat overdone in the era when written. The general style of the book is notable for its crystal purity and its closeness of detail. The writer, who is the wife of a professor in a theological seminary, has evidently watched the scenes she describes, whether of home life in Germany, or mountain views in Saxony, or the Passion Play at Oberammergau, or works of art in the galleries. She is a good observer; knows what features to describe and how to group them; and then puts them into an artistic setting of pure English that is always elegant and often rises to the poetic. The book is as valuable for its information as it is interesting for its story. In this, as in some other respects, it far surpasses her previous works. The art criticisms are modest and unpretentious, but discriminating; the author manifestly bas no fear of Rubens before her eyes. The chapter describing the Passion Play at Oberammergau is interesting and valuable. The author witnessed the play in 1871, and her descriptions of it then in the columns of a religious weekly were admired and enjoyed by readers. \nAccording to a review in The New Englander (1876), there are a few flaws in this story. But they are all on the surface and easily detected, we example being the title. There are one or two typographical errors in the misspelling of names. The affixing of the title Herr to Mr. Vassar strikes us as inconsistent with the fact that that gentleman is not a German, but an American. If it were necessary, some cases in which the good Herr uses words in his narrative which seem too much like the elevated diction of Pope to be natural in even highly cultivated conversation. \n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe New York Times published a scathing review:\u2014We may commend this book to all readers who are incapable of digesting any but the very weakest description of mental food. It is a story of German social life in which Christine Follen, an improbable peasant girl of Rhineland, is the heroine. The construction of the plot is faulty, and the introduction of one Herr Vassar, though whom the tale is unfolded, is clumsy and quite unnecessary. The author's men are not men. The characters are not individualized. In everybody, we recognize Mrs. Goodwin Talcott. Men do not talk as Herr Vassar and Col. Ranney, an officer in the British Army, talk, while the latter uses expressions which are never heard among Englishmen. The author's descriptions of wild flowers are also far from accurate; and, finally, there is no purpose to the story. No high principle is upheld; no evil is exposed; no moral is to be found. Some readers may perhaps be disposed to question whether such a narrative of the fortunes of a young peasant girl may not have a bad rather than a good tendency, and we should not be indisposed to take part with such. In fact, it is one of that vast multitude of books which seem to have to reason for being, which make us think with wonder at the quantities of spare cash which some writers must possess if they pay their publishers, and which find readers, if they have them at all, in quarters that are far beyond the ken of people of average understanding.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMrs. Goodwin-Talcott, The Fortunes of Miss Follen, (New York, D.

Contrary to the then-popular view that juvenile delinquents should be led to respect societal norms, Goodman argued that young American men were justified in their disaffection because their society lacked the preconditions for growing up, such as meaningful work, honorable community, sexual freedom, and spiritual sustenance.\nGoodman's book drew from his prior works, psychotherapy practice, and personal experiences and relations in New York City. The small New York press that originally commissioned the book asked Goodman to return his advance when the resulting book, written in late 1959, focused less on the commissioned subject of city youth gangs than on the American culture and value systems in which the youth were raised. Nineteen publishers rejected Growing Up Absurd before Norman Podhoretz used selections from the book to relaunch his magazine, Commentary. After Podhoretz encouraged Random House publisher Jason Epstein to reconsider the book, Goodman had a contract the next day. Random House published Growing Up Absurd in 1960 and a Vintage Books paperback edition followed two years later.\nGrowing Up Absurd became a bestseller with 100,000 copies sold in its first three years and translations into five languages. It was widely read across 1960s college campuses and popular among student activists and the New Left, who assimilated the author's ideology. Growing Up Absurd transformed Goodman's outcast career into mainstream notoriety as a social critic, including invitations to lecture at hundreds of colleges, though Goodman's fame did not endure long after his death in 1972. Many specifics of Growing Up Absurd became dated with time and, in later years, retrospective reviewers criticized Goodman's exclusion of women from his analysis. New York Review Books reissued Growing Up Absurd in 2012.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the United States, the affluent postwar 1950s was a time of both general prosperity and conformity. The latter had become a theme of social criticism by the decade's end. Critiques on the relation between social norms and the individual psyche included David Riesman's The Lonely Crowd (1950), William H. Whyte's The Organization Man (1956), and Vance Packard's The Status Seekers (1959). As a whole, this literature portrayed American culture as white-collar subservience to mass advertising and corporate life. Paul Goodman's Growing Up Absurd (1960) belongs to this tradition, having consolidated, as historian Kevin Mattson put it, \"a decade's worth of social criticism\".\nAmong American writers of the period, concern for proper childrearing and education loomed larger than questions of workplace conformity and middle-class standards. They largely wrote in disapproval of what youth culture portended for the country's future. The image of the juvenile delinquent became a pervasive symbol for this decline, reflected in the rise of urban youth gang warfare and the popular portrayal of the maladjusted, non-conformist outsider in films and theater such as The Wild One (1953), Rebel Without a Cause (1955), East of Eden (1955), and West Side Story (1957).\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nIn Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized System, Paul Goodman faults American culture and values for the rise of juvenile delinquency in the late 1950s. Delinquency and \"dropping out\" of society, Goodman argues, are sane and justified responses to an adult society not worth growing up into, lacking in meaningful vocation, honorable community, sexual freedom, spiritual sustenance, and other qualities that youth require in their society to develop their social and moral identities, i.e. to grow up. He writes primarily about disaffected young men\u2014urban juvenile delinquents and the beatnik subculture\u2014and refers to the prevalent sterile, conformist American social order as the \"organized system\". Goodman disagrees with the then-common view that the solution for youth disaffection was to bring the youth to respect societal norms. Siding with the youth, he argues that the young already understood and rejected societal standards as unimportant. In this way, Goodman makes the youth social problem into less a problem than a symptom of a more existential need.\nGoodman contends that American society ruined the concept of vocation and created artificial demands through advertising. Affluent, postwar advanced capitalism boasted high employment but, Goodman writes, at the cost of reliance on \"artificial ... demand for useless goods\" that created unfulfilling, bureaucratic work, without a sense of purpose or service. Goodman believes that vocation that focuses on use, interest, style, and love has meaning and self-justified purpose, but that work focused on role, procedure, and profit tends towards meaninglessness. Thus youth were rightfully disaffected, says Goodman, at the prospect of joining an adult society lacking fulfillment. The chapters of Growing Up Absurd apply this argument to facets of life including \"Faith\", \"Jobs\", \"Patriotism\", and sexuality (\"Social Animal\").\nGoodman describes the period's mechanical social order and its feeling of inescapability and forced conformity as an \"apparently closed room\" fixated on a \"rat race\". He posits that citizens traded the simple pleasures of daily life for the securities of living under an affluent, mechanized order enabled by corporations, a situation he calls \"sociolatry\". To Goodman, this trade-off\u2014that a society would choose the preservation of its systems over the sake of its own people\u2014is \"absurd\". \nGoodman holds that \"socializing\" youth to play specialized roles in an adult society is inherently wrong for betraying their nature in the name of societal benefit. Goodman asks, \"Socialization to what?\" If societal aims are wrong, the urge to socialize children to societal roles becomes circular and self-serving. No amount of amelioration, he writes, including better schools or more social workers\u2014would justify this socialization. Those seeking to correct delinquency, Goodman says, should instead improve society and culture's opportunities to meet the appetites of human nature. Goodman faulted social critics, including himself, and academic sociologists for being content with studying this system without endeavoring to change it. He posits that attempts to mold human nature to social order would backfire, and that \"freedom and meaning will outweigh anomie\" if given the chance.\nTo create a society worthy for youth to want to join, Goodman resolves, certain \"unfinished\" revolutions must be brought to their conclusion on topics including companionship, democracy, free speech, pacifism, progressive education, syndicalism, and technology. He implores readers to pursue these ideals seriously, and to direct their rebellion towards political ends, in the book's final chapter, \"The Missing Community\".\n\n\n== Publication ==\n\nAuthor Paul Goodman had a marginal intellectual career before publishing Growing Up Absurd, both prolific and on the fringe. Throughout the 1950s, Goodman developed his practice of Gestalt therapy and finished his epic novel The Empire City, which ends with its protagonist \"spoiling for a fight\" against a target the author was unable to articulate. Goodman, who conflated the fictional protagonist with himself, came to conclude that his fictional character's desire for a fight was the author's own, and that it would be \"war against the Organized System\" to reclaim his sick society from the forces that alienated him. Goodman's Growing Up Absurd was the beginning of this campaign, which would run throughout the rest of the 1960s. Like Goodman's protagonist, Goodman believed that he had to work through his societal alienation by participating in society. He drew from his approach to psychotherapy, which focused on changing societal circumstances rather than his clients.\nIn late 1958, mainstream editors began to court Goodman for works of social criticism after reading his articles in small political and cultural magazines. Through the winter, he read Washington, Jefferson, Thoreau, and Emerson and considered how he might make his own patriotic intervention in American society. A small New York press, Criterion Books, offered Goodman a $500 advance to write a book on New York's teenage gangs in the summer of mid-1959. The resulting manuscript did not focus on the youth but the American culture and value systems in which the youth were raised. Goodman wrote the manuscript over several weeks that autumn. The final work thematically derived from topics he had been addressing for years, such that some parts were simply quoted from past works. He drew from his personal interactions in New York City, his teaching experience, and his colleagues Benjamin Nelson, Harold Rosenberg, and Elliott Shapiro. The book's section on vocation was informed by Max Weber's essays on vocation.\nGoodman wrote in his diary that upon finishing his last chapter, he whistled \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as he walked the chapter to his publisher. He saw himself as patriotically defending his country against \"the system\". Goodman believed that the issues of conformity and alienation described in his manuscript were better expressed as political than as cultural issues. He wanted his political message to be read in advance of the 1960 presidential campaign. The publisher decided not to publish the manuscript and asked Goodman to return the advance for delivering work unfit for print. The manuscript was rejected by 19 publishers, including the publisher that would ultimately print it.\nIn his memoir, Commentary magazine editor Norman Podhoretz wrote that he had been searching for an \"opening salvo\" on juvenile delinquency and middle-class youth deviance, a highly publicized topic, to mark his magazine's reimagination as a home for American social criticism. Most treatments of the subject, he wrote, described the phenomenon as \"unrelated incidents of individual pathology ... to be dealt with either sternly by the cops or benevolently by the psychiatrists\". He heard about Goodman's finished manuscript and had a long-standing admiration for the author's writing and \"colloquial directness\". Though Podhoretz considered the initial excerpt he read of Goodman's manuscript to be uninteresting, he was impressed by the work as \"the very incarnation of the new spirit [he] had been hoping would be at work in the world\".\nAccording to Podhoretz's memoir, he excitedly called Random House editor Jason Epstein, whom he convinced to come over and read the manuscript that night. Though Random House had previously rejected the manuscript and Epstein thought Goodman a \"has-been\", Goodman had a contract the next day. With the book's release planned for later in 1960, Goodman and Podhoretz revised over half the manuscript into three extended serial extracts for the editor's Commentary magazine reboot. These extracts ran in February, March, and April 1960. Extracts also ran in Dissent, Mademoiselle, and Manas around the same time. \nGoodman was confident that his message was clear and agreeable. According to Goodman's later literary executor, in Growing Up Absurd Goodman tried a new style that was powerfully earnest, direct, and patient, whereas his prior writing had qualities of hectoring insistence and recklessness. Goodman normally rejected attempts to revise his work, but approved of Random House's appointed book editor. According to Goodman's brother, these were the only edits Goodman permitted in his career. \nRandom House published the book's first edition in 1960 and Vintage Books printed the first paperback two years later. Growing Up Absurd was translated into French (1971), German (1971), Italian (1964), Japanese (1971), and Spanish (1971). The book's appendices include articles and book reviews by Goodman from the late 1950s. Goodman dedicated Growing Up Absurd to the Gestalt psychotherapist Lore Perls for her role in helping train and mentor him as a therapist, cooling his defiance, and enabling him such that he could write the book. New York Review Books reissued the book in 2012 with a foreword by Casey Nelson Blake.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReleased to initially moderate acclaim, Growing Up Absurd became a bestseller, with 100,000 copies sold in three years and half a million paperback copies printed by 1973. Growing Up Absurd enjoyed wide readership among the New Left and across 1960s college campuses, becoming the foremost book by which 1960s American youth understood themselves. Goodman's ideas proved popular with student activists, and it was said that every activist at Berkeley had a copy, even if few read the full text. Americans had seen isolated headlines on juvenile delinquency but had not noticed the similar patterns between both urban youth and beatnik revolt against societal pressures. To this public, Goodman's literary executor Taylor Stoehr recounted, Growing Up Absurd was \"a revelation\". Chapters from the book were republished in radical and mainstream magazines. Commentary readers responded positively and the revamped magazine's editor Norman Podhoretz credited the strong response to Growing Up Absurd's serialized extractions for Commentary's quick ascent. Following the book's success, Goodman's publisher expressed interest in reprinting his Communitas. Extracts from Growing Up Absurd later ran in the Evergreen Review and many edited group volumes. In contrast with the American response, the British press panned the book.\nGrowing Up Absurd was revelatory to readers who had not previously connected the concept of work with ideals, wrote Goodman's literary executor. To this new audience, Goodman read as both fresh and old-fashioned: a contemporary man of letters's unabashed advocacy for a moral culture with traditional values of faith, honor, vocation. Goodman's discussion of the \"rat race\" and worthwhile work too resonated with college students, who had similar realizations, but was more distant to adults who had grown accustomed to the American nature of work. The book's advocacy for youth's sexual freedom was shocking to older readers, and some accused Goodman of using the book to argue for acceptance of sexual deviance.\nContemporaneously, public intellectual John K. Galbraith described Goodman's book as hard to read from its title to its appendix, in contrast to the increasingly commonplace slick and superficial mass market works of criticism. Dwight Macdonald too lamented Goodman's writing being less clear than his thinking, though Macdonald admired Growing Up Absurd among Goodman's oeuvre. Literary critic Kingsley Widmer described Goodman's rhetoric as varying between righteousness, condescension, and magnanimity. As one later reviewer put it, Goodman was not supporting youth as much as psychologizing them and their societal alienation.\nSome critics focused on Goodman's ability to offer solutions. That youth want meaningful work, said The Times Literary Supplement, is a tautology. Though it is easier to puritanically agree with Goodman's assessment of societal downfalls, the reviewer said, it is harder to ascertain why we agree with these aims yet cannot seem to achieve them. In this way, Goodman banked too heavily on the miraculous changing of minds rather than meeting people where they were. Galbraith's New York Times review considered Growing Up Absurd a \"serious effort\" despite not offering robust solutions.\nOn the occasion of the book's 2012 reprint, one retrospective reviewer considered the book's core issues of corporate greed and spiritual barrenness as being more pronounced than 50 years prior. Literary critic Adam Kirsch wrote that Goodman's focus on work with meaning was priced out of possibility in a highly stratified contemporary culture, in which working multiple jobs to provide for basic necessities leaves little time for consideration of work's meaning.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nFueled by the changing desires of the times, including a willingness to address societal issues, Growing Up Absurd transformed Goodman's outcast career and brought him public fame as a social critic and educational theorist. He emerged from the publication with attention he had long sought and a role as a public intellectual. Some of Goodman's ideas have been assimilated into mainstream thought: local community autonomy and decentralization, better balance between rural and urban life, morality-led technological advances, break-up of regimented schooling, art in mass media, and a culture less focused on a wasteful standard of living. His systemic societal critique was adopted by 1960s New Left radicals, whose aspirations included an emphasis on moral living. Growing Up Absurd's main contribution, literary critic Kingsley Widmer contended, was in focusing public attention \"on the discontents of the young and the lack of humane values in much of our technocracy\".\nGoodman bridged the 1950s era of mass conformity and repression into the 1960s era of youth counterculture in his encouragement of dissent. He became a popular guest speaker both for the book's resonance with 1960s youth and for his criticism of the youth movement's excesses. He was invited to lecture at hundreds of colleges and presented as a \"public gadfly\" agitating for change. Widmer believed that the practical idealism Goodman had wanted for the young was partially realized in the 1964 Berkeley Free Speech Movement. As 1960s campus rebellions suggested the possibility of greater societal change, Goodman and the youth shared mutual sympathies for several years.\nThough some criticized his flattery of his young followers, Goodman also played the role of their Dutch uncle, receiving the respect of the 1960s youth generation despite issuing harsh opinions about them. His followers misinterpreted the source of the author's rebellion, according to Goodman's literary executor. Whereas the youth saw Goodman's outr\u00e9 positions on art, politics, and sexuality as principled defiance, they were more accurately Goodman's own idiosyncratic personal refusal to acquiesce to societal norms. Both interpretations built his affinity with the youth, as did his emphasis on older ideals, acts, and individuals in which youth could feel a sense of justified pride. Goodman often reminded his young audiences of their inexperience and encouraged them to pursue vocational mastery if they wanted to make a better world. Literary critic Adam Kirsch retrospectively suggested that Goodman appealed to the youth by flattering their ignorance and sense of moral superiority. This demagoguery, wrote Kirsch, belied Goodman's responsibility as an elder teacher to help the youth to find contentment in an imperfect world rife with evils and suffering, rather than holding out for a perfect world as the only acceptable world.\nMany specific details of the book soon became dated. Youth gangs persisted, but juvenile delinquency as a topic did not, and the disaffected beatniks successively traded favor for hippies and punks. Though world politics were not a central focus, Cold War-era historical touchpoints pervade the book. Goodman also underemphasized the role of racial conflict, as his discussion of impoverished youth focused mainly on socioeconomic needs. As criticism of American society, Growing Up Absurd appeared mild by the beginning of the 1970s, according to Merle Miller.\nGoodman's patriarchal assumptions about gender and treatment of women, exemplified in his focus on \"man's work\", were rebuked in early reviews and in the following decades. In particular, he wrote that the book focuses exclusively on men and their careers because women, having the capacity for childbirth, did not need a career to justify their worth. By his literary executor's account, this was a blind spot for Goodman. Retrospective reviews reproached Goodman's analytic exclusion of women and one cited it as sufficient reason to not want for a \"Goodman revival\". Goodman's analysis of men similarly narrows to \"manly\" lad culture, excluding those from upper-class or non-urban backgrounds.\nLooking back on Goodman's career, Kingsley Widmer panned Growing Up Absurd as rough, rambling, and mediocre despite its insights and sociological vision. Overall, Widmer considered Goodman's analysis of vocational and community issues to be unserious, and Goodman's thoughts on decentralization and schooling to be better expressed in other works.\nGrowing Up Absurd was among the first works of American school social criticism in a 1960s body of literature that became known as the romantic critics of education. Critics of public schools borrowed the book's ideas for years after its publication, and his ideas on education reverberated for decades. Adam Kirsch wrote that Goodman's \"acute, compassionate observations\" about childhood under modern conditions and portrayal of \"childhood as a pastoral paradise lost\" contributes to the book's continued staying power.\nGrowing Up Absurd was continually in print as of 1990 but was not in high demand as a classic. Although the book made him well-known, Goodman's public interest peaked with his late 1960s youth readership. His influence never took hold in the wider public, and within decades Goodman was largely forgotten from public consciousness. His literary executor wrote that much of Goodman's effectiveness relied on his electric, cantankerous presence. Over time, the idea of \"the system\" entered common language and ceased to be a rallying cry. Into the 21st century, Growing Up Absurd continues to appeal to \"the adolescent's private sense of being misunderstood by a heartless and empty world\" as young readers share online how the book has affected their lives.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFull text at the Internet Archive",
            "Of Boys and Men: Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It (2022) is a book by British author Richard Reeves. \nIn the book, Reeves argues that the advancement of women's rights and the changing job market, which now values cognitive skills over physical strength, have left some men feeling insecure and uncertain about their place in the world (i.e. without ontological security).\nThe book also highlights the difficulties boys face in education. It suggests that boys are not performing as well academically as girls (with women outperforming men in various academic and professional domains), which can affect their future opportunities and contribute to their overall sense of frustration. It also notes the struggles faced by men in fulfilling their roles as providers and fathers, citing research which says that men in the US are now more likely to feel socially excluded and less likely to be successful after divorce.\nReeves says that these challenges have particularly hit Black men the hardest, as years of higher incarceration rates among Black men have severely limited their prospects in life. Similarly, men without college degrees have experienced declining wages, notable drops in life expectancy, and increased rates of family disruption. He notes that aspects of hypermasculinity promoted by popular culture is off-putting to modern men, and says that efforts towards achieving gender equality should now prioritize addressing the needs and concerns of boys rather than exclusively focusing on girls and women.\n\n\n== References ==",
            "Packaged Pleasures: How Technology and Marketing Revolutionized Desire is a 2014 nonfiction book written by Gary S. Cross and Robert N. Proctor and published by the University of Chicago Press. It analyzes the history of packaging through a number of case studies and how the rise of capitalism has led to rapid innovation and usage of packages throughout the world in order to satiate people's desire for goods.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe book contains nine chapters, a notes section with references, and an index. Each chapter discusses a specific topic and aspect of packaging and production. The title's subject is addressed in an introductory chapter going over how consumer culture has led to transforming what were once \"fleeting and sensory experiences\" involving activities and even gifts and transformed them into \"transmissible packets of pleasure\" with our package-based society. Specific individuals and their inventions are referred to as \"pleasure engineers\" in the book, owing to how they managed to \"optimize sensory pleasure\" in their customers. The people discussed include Thomas Edison, John Cadbury, George Eastman, and Walt Disney. Works by authors including Emile Durkheim and Aldous Huxley are referenced to describe how the consuming public has become \"hedonistic, self-centered, and only interested in self-gratification\".\nThe second chapter then goes on to focus on pre-history, early civilizations, and the storage of items and foods at the time, along with how foods were preserved in a time period before canning was available. Multiple stories and historical examples are used to describe the first major innovation of \"tubularization\" and how mass production of packaging began at the end of the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution booming in the 20th century. Packaging for public sale of goods also required the invention of advertising methods and the formation of brand goods. The type of packaging used also had to change over time, moving from the development of large-scale paper production to the use of plastic and other materials.\nThe chapter on food analyzes how fat and sugar have become commodities of the general public and not just the rich and elite, making them abundant and increasing their negative impact on peoples' health. The process of preservation packaging has also allowed for sweets like candy bars to be sold everywhere and be more preferable to a carrot as a snack. These food options are referred to as \"superfoods\" or \"pseudofoods\" in the book because they are packaged and engineered with little nutritional value and highly attractive branded marketing. A chapter on cigarettes describes them as the \"quintessential packaged pleasure\" thanks to their portable, convenient, and generally cheap design. Other example sensory pleasures used include amusement parks, phonographs, and film and cinema. These discussions also move beyond the history of the United States and include the international sale of goods and how packaging was conducted around the world. The final few chapters cover the rest of the past century and the expanding influence of technology on how packaged goods are bought, sold, and sent to customers, along with the development of powdered foods and the ubiquitous use of square cardboard boxes instead of tubes.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nIn a review for the journal Technology and Culture, Kathleen Franz approved how the book expands our understanding of the subject via case studies and with a discussion of how issues like obesity, cancer, and overconsumption of resources have affected the world, but agreed with the authors that the book deals with the entirety of its investigation with a lighter general hand despite the case studies because of how quickly it glosses over entire topics. Gastronomica writer Zenia Malmer explained their wishes that the book had been more critical of the ads and other things discussed, along with presenting the consumer's perspective for the products included, but concluded that it was a \"good starting point\" for those that wish to read and study the history of consumerism. Brent Malin, reviewing for The Journal of American History, criticized the intensification thesis of the book and felt it was not strongly backed up by the case study examples, with the examples of radio and amusement parks stretching the package theme \"to the point of losing its utility\". He took particular issue with the idea of better music technologies making listening to music more stimulating and thought it was \"historically myopic\" as an idea, being claimed about many previous technologies including the telegraph.\nFood, Culture & Society's Jan Whitaker considered the book \"provocative\" and that it \"holds promise\" for driving discussion into new areas in food history research, but was critical of how the authors \"back away from judgement\" of consumer culture and the idea of a pleasure society. Andrew P. Haley in The American Historical Review called the book \"itself a packaged pleasure\" that provided a \"fresh account\" of the history of mass production, though Haley wished the work took a stronger stance against consumerism rather than pushing away concerns over the \"democratization of culture\". In a review for Times Higher Education, Isabelle Szmigin stated that the book includes a \"comprehensive discussion\" of the history of consumer goods and that it has a methodical use of references and insight into the history of various products. But the reviewer also questions whether the general idea has a \"nagging sense of elitism\" that would result in calling for less developed countries to not receive the benefits of consumerization that developed countries already have and if the benefits of decreasing hunger and other problems packaged products have provided were being overlooked.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial press release",
            "Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now is a non-fiction work written by Douglas Rushkoff and published in 2013. The book introduces the concept of present shock, a state of anxiety which people all live with as they try to keep up with the ever-increasing speed and immediacy of time. The instantaneous nature of digital technology has shaped the way humanity perceives and deals with time.  According to Rushkoff, rather than focusing on building a better future, society is primarily concerned with building a worthwhile present.  Rushkoff addresses brands, pop culture, news outlets and political movements, with particular attention to the post-Y2K era, in an attempt to explain the effects of presentism on modern humanity.\nPresent Shock is considered by some critics to be a contemporary variant of Alvin Toffler\u2019s 1970s work, Future Shock, which suggested consequences of \u201ctoo much change in too short a period of time.\u201d According to Janet Maslin, whereas Toffler's take on the subject is more alarmist, Rushkoff takes an analytical approach to the perception of time.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Narrative Collapse ===\nRushkoff references the effect of live news reporting and the emergence of pop culture to make sense of diminishing attention spans and the need for instantaneous gratification from TV programs.  He suggests we no longer have the patience to endure linear storylines.  The solution he provides is to allow viewers to insert themselves directly into the narrative, becoming a participant rather than a spectator.\n\n\n=== Digiphrenia ===\nDigiphrenia is described as what happens when one does insert themselves into a narrative.  This insertion happens repeatedly until they are trying to manage multiple versions of themselves simultaneously, making it more difficult for their mind to process the digital multi-tasking.  Rushkoff suggests self-awareness can assist in this process.  Being able to identify when the right time is to insert oneself into a narrative and when to seclude oneself can be helpful in dealing with multi-tasking.\n\n\n=== Overwinding ===\nOverwinding refers to the tendency to think of immense time periods squished into smaller or even nonexistent periods.  Rushkoff believes this springloading of time from future into present is the cause of Black Friday beginning earlier each year or the need for traders to eliminate milliseconds off their deals to gain an advantage.\n\n\n=== Fractalnoia ===\nAccording to Rushkoff, the absence of a linear narrative makes the intricacies of cause and effect more difficult. The time between something and its result is diminished to nothing, and when the happens, following the story beginning to end becomes impossible.  Fractalnoia addresses the emergence of big data and how it has begun to affect the abilities of pattern recognition. Too much data creates chaos for one to make sense of the multitude of connections between the data.  Despite the emergence of social media and ease of making connections, we can no longer keep up with them.\n\n\n=== Apocalypto ===\nSociety has become infatuated with apocalyptic themes because of an underlying desire to break out of the current situation we're in.  Rushkoff suggests the pressure of time is a burden and we have lost faith in our ability to solve global crises, which has led to the existence of doomsday preppers and obsessions with the Mayan Calendar.  As a solution, he urges us to relax and adopt a more practical outlook to the future.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAfter publishing in 2013, Present Shock was reviewed by numerous outlets including Forbes, The New York Times, and Wired.com.  Rushkoff gave talks at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, PSFK and Ted about Present Shock and the new digital age.\n\n\n== References ==",

The tablet (as Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's works are often called) was written during his time in Baghdad (1853-1863) in Arabic, and was published in English in 2002.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe work was written in reply to a question from Siyyid Y\u00fasuf-i-Sidih\u00ed Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed, a religious leader of the Shi\u02bbas in Najaf, who had asked the question of how the promised Mahdi could have been \"transformed\" (meaning: the return of the Promised One in a different human guise) into Ali-Muhammad the (B\u00e1b). The work was written on the same day as the question had been received and delivered through an intermediary.\nAccording to a compilation published in 2000 by researchers at the Wilmette Institute, Siyyid Y\u00fasuf-i-Sidih\u00ed Isfah\u00e1n\u00ed, who was residing in Karbila when the tablet was written, recognized the divinity of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h after reading the tablet. When he met Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h later, he became a Babi. His friends rejected him for becoming a Babi and he could no longer stay in their home.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\nBah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h himself states that he took \"the opportunity provided by\" the question \"to elaborate on a number of subjects\". The introduction of the published English translation lists some of these topics, some of which are: \"rejection of the Prophets of the past,\" \"danger of a literal reading of scripture,\" \"the meaning of the signs and portents of the Bible concerning the advent of the new Manifestation,\" \"the continuity of divine revelation,\" \"intimations of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's approaching declaration,\" and the significance or meanings of terms such as \"Day of Judgement\" and \"the Resurrection.\"\nSimilar themes as those presented in the Gems of Divine Mysteries can be found in the Seven Valleys and in the Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n.\n\n\n== Translation ==\nThe governing body of the Baha'i Faith global community, the Universal House of Justice, announced in April 2001, as part of its ongoing five-year plan, that the Centre for the Study of the Texts \u2014  at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre \u2014 would \"focus on translations into English from the Holy Texts.\" The publication of Gems of Divine Mysteries was one of the projects undertaken in fulfilment of that five-year plan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJabulqa and Jabulsa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHatcher, J.S.

            "Histoire de ma vie is an autobiography by George Sand covering her life up to shortly before the Revolution of 1848. The autobiography was published in Paris in 1854 and 1855 by Victor Lecou.\nGeorge Sand had planned as early as 1835, shortly after the end of her relationship with Alfred de Musset, to write her memoirs. She started in April 1847 and, with many interruptions for other work, finished her memoirs in 1855. In the autobiography the dates and the succession of events are not entirely veracious. The work consists largely of extensive rewriting of letters that she sent and received. Histoire de ma vie is a literary masterpiece with value as a social document and a family history.\n\nAvec une rare lucidit\u00e9, elle analyse le \u00abdevenir soi\u00bb d\u2019un caract\u00e8re, rappelle sa petite enfance \u00e0 Nohant, les conflits familiaux qui la d\u00e9chirent, les tensions qui habitent une famille bris\u00e9e par la mort du p\u00e8re, la grande m\u00e9lancolie qui s\u2019ensuit, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa tentative de suicide \u00e0 17 ans. Si elle \u00e9voque admirablement le pass\u00e9, Sand sait aussi dire le pr\u00e9sent et l\u2019avenir : elle expose ses vues sur le devenir de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le r\u00f4le de la religion, la condition des femmes. Histoire de ma vie reste un mod\u00e8le de vivacit\u00e9, de courage, de franchise et de d\u00e9termination.\n(With a rare lucidity, she analyzes the \"developing self\" of a character, recalls her early childhood in Nohant, the family conflicts that lacerate her, the tensions plaguing a family broken by the death of the father, the great melancholy that ensues, leading up to her suicide attempt at age 17. If she evokes the past admirably, she also knows how to tell the present and the future: she set forth her views on the future of society, the role of religion, and the condition of women. Histoire de ma vie remains a model of courage, frankness and determination.)\nThe 1856 edition published in Paris by Michel L\u00e9vy Fr\u00e8res consists of 5 separate books with a total of 13 chapters. Histoire de ma vie is organized into 5 parts:\n\nHistoire d\u2019une famille de Fontenoy \u00e0 Marengo;\nMes premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es (1800\u20131811);\nDe l\u2019enfance \u00e0 la jeunesse (1810\u20131819);\nDu mysticisme \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance (1819\u20131832);\nVie litt\u00e9raire et intime.\nGallimard published in 1970 an edition which was edited by Georges Lubin and then translated into English by a team of translators led by Thelma Jurgrau. The translation was published by State University of New York Press in 1991 with the title Story of My Life: The Autobiography of George Sand.\n\nIt was an open secret that many of George Sand's novels were woven out of her own experience; that many of her persons were elaborate studies of men and women that she had known, or were at least ideal developments of the dispositions of living people. It was the strangeness of her private life, and the many stories about her, that first caused intense excitement about her early writings. All through her career she kept up a personal relation with her readers, telling them in prefaces to her novels, or in Les Lettres d\u2019un voyageur, something about her own state of mind, and her own judgment of her performances. Of course it was never the real George Sand that appeared in these confidences, but the ideal George Sand of the moment. The same half-imaginary being is the heroine of L\u2019Histoire de ma vie, a book very useful to the student of the psychology of Madame Dudevandt. The incomplete autobiography has been called a romance; but at least it states events as the writer preferred to think that they happened, and displays herself as she saw herself in the mirror of her own fantasy. .... She was borne by her own courage and intellectual energy into the tempest of opinions, and was tossed hither and thither among unscrupulous men, for whom she was more than a match.\n\n\n== References ==",
            "\"Isle of the Cross\" (c.\u20091853) is a possible unpublished and lost work by Herman Melville, which would have been his eighth book, coming after the commercial and critical failures of  Moby-Dick (1851) and Pierre: or, The Ambiguities (1852).  Melville biographer Hershel Parker suggests that the work, perhaps a novel, perhaps a story, was what had been known as the \"story of Agatha,\" completed around May 1853. He further suggests that finishing the work showed that Melville had not, as many biographers argued, been discouraged and turned away from fiction.\nUnlike almost all of Melville's other fiction, this work has a female central character.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn a visit to Nantucket in July 1852 John H. Clifford, a New Bedford lawyer, state attorney general, and friend of Melville's father-in-law Lemuel Shaw, told Melville the story of Agatha Hatch Robertson, a Nantucket woman who had cared for a shipwrecked sailor named Robertson. After their marriage, Robertson abandoned her and their daughter, only to return seventeen years later, then to abandon them once again and be exposed as a bigamist.\nIn a letter to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne Melville described \"the great patience, & endurance, & resignedness of the women of the island in submitting so uncomplainingly to the long, long absences of their sailor husbands,\"  and urged Hawthorne to adopt this \"little idea.\"  Hawthorne did not take up the idea, however. Melville worked on the manuscript in the summer and winter of 1852.\nWhen Melville took a manuscript to his New York publishers, Harper & Brothers, in June 1853, they rejected the work. The publisher was possibly concerned about poor reviews of Pierre, or feared legal action from Agatha Hatch's family.\n\n\n== Subsequent scholarship ==\nAlthough Melville's first biographers did not know of its existence, as early as 1922 the writer Meade Minnigerode found a cache of Melville family letters in the New York Public Library which included several references in 1853 to a major work which was not subsequently published. Harrison Hayford in 1946 suggested that the confirmation in a newly found letter that Melville had completed a major project after the failure of Moby-Dick exposed \"serious errors in the theory now generally held\", that Melville \"in despair and defiance at the reception of Moby-Dick had written Pierre with \"no expectation that it would succeed with the public\", and expected that it would be his last book. Merton M. Sealts, Jr., in state of the field note of 1980, endorsed the possibility that Melville wrote the story in the winter of 1853 with Hawthorne's style in mind and that the work was a transition toward the \"Hawthornesqe  symbolism\" of Melville's later stories.  Sealts quotes Melville's letter to Harper's Magazine of November 24, 1853, referring to \"the work which I took to New York last Spring, but which I was prevented from printing at that time...\"  Parker in 1990 suggested that the \"Agatha story\" was the \"Isle of the Cross\"  and devoted extensive space to it in the second volume of his Melville biography. In 1991, Basem L. Ra'ad concluded that \"The Isle of the Cross\" refers to a story, not a full-length book, and that the story was incorporated into \"Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles\", a series of sketches published in The Piazza Tales.\nSome reviewers of his Herman Melville: A Biography (2002) still objected to Parker's identification of the lost manuscript with \"Isle of the Cross\". Richard H. Brodhead, then of Yale University, writing in the New York Times of June 23, 2002, labelled Parker's \"surmise\" as \"dubious,\" and Andrew Delbanco of Columbia University, wrote in The New Republic, that Parker \"trusts his own intuition\" and presents \"inferences as facts,\" for \"such a book was never published \u2013 and it is a surmise that Melville ever wrote it.\" Parker replied that the \"surmise\" was based on a line of Melville scholarship going back to the 1920s which Broadhead did not appear to be familiar with, and that Delbanco's \"ignorance of three quarters of a century of scholarship\" was \"baffling.\" In 2012 Parker noted that in Delbanco's own 2006 biography of Melville, he \"had somehow learned about the existence\" of \"The Isle of the Cross,\" which he had \"assured the readers of The New Republic I had merely 'surmised.'\"\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nIn the novel The Secret of Lost Things by Sheridan Hay, one of the characters, Walter Geist, is secretly purchasing the original manuscript of \"Isle of the Cross\".\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHayford, Harrison (1946). \"The Significance of Melville's \"Agatha\" Letters\".

            "The Mammals of Australia is a three-volume work written and published by John Gould between 1845\u201363. It contains 182 illustrations by the author and its artist H. C. Richter. It was intended to be a complete survey of the novel species of mammals, such as the marsupials, discovered in the colonies of Australia.\n\n\n== Author ==\nThe author, John Gould, best known for The Birds of Australia and other major works of ornithology, visited Australia in 1838. In his introduction, Gould says:\n\nIt was not until I arrived in the country, and found myself surrounded by objects as strange as if I had been transported to another planet, that I conceived the idea of devoting a portion of my attention to the mammalian class of its extraordinary fauna.\nDuring his short stay he made observations on the natural history and employed his skills as a taxidermist to obtain specimens.\n\n\n== First survey ==\nThe publication of this major work by Gould followed his A Monograph of the Macropodidae or Family of Kangaroos in 1841. This work was the first comprehensive survey of Australian mammals, and gave an account of their classification and description. Gould also included the indigenous names for the species from the lists he made while in Australia. He used these names to make requests of the local peoples for his specimens, and recorded the regions where the names were used. This conserved a number of common names, such as dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), which were later recommended by authorities.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\n\nThe large lithographs reproduced the artwork of Richter, after the drawings and watercolours made in Australia by Gould and his wife, Elizabeth. (The contribution by Elizabeth Gould was uncredited). These were hand-coloured by a group of artists, led by Gabriel Bayfield, that required the completion of 26,572 plates. The illustrations produced during their visit to Australia were supplemented by the preserved specimens returned to England and detailed the characteristics of the species. These illustrations have become iconic images of the mammals of Australia. Among the best known of the illustrations from the work are the two of Thylacinus cynocephalus (Tasmanian tiger), copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced, made more recognizable by Cascade Brewery's appropriation for its label in 1987. The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934, the author Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for Tasmanian Friends and Foes (1881).\n\n\n== Subscription format ==\nThe Mammals of Australia was published by subscription in the format Imperial Folio; 13 parts in three volumes were issued from 1845 until 1863. To these the author added An Introduction to The Mammals of Australia (1863) in a separate work. This provided corrections and updates, a new preface, introduction, and a list of the mammals of the three volumes. The first two volumes were complete surveys of orders 'Marsupiata' (marsupials), and, with Rodentia in the third, it formed the sum of known mammalian species of Australia. With the addition of those contained in the later Introduction the total of species described reached 166. The same work notes the exclusion of marine mammals such as whales from the volumes, but reprints a manuscript by Charles Coxen on the dugong.\nBeyond the scientific value of this comprehensive survey, the document is cited in reference to its subject's conservation. Some of the species included in the work, such as Onychogalea lunata (crescent nailtail wallaby), have since succumbed to changes in land use since European colonisation.\n\nThe work was received with acclaim, but the high cost of production, especially of the coloured plates, reduced its accessibility. The original listed price was \u00a341 for the complete set of volumes.  The public curiosity for the unique fauna of Australia was met by this handsomely illustrated and comprehensive survey, and it spawned imitations in Australia. The curator of the Australian Museum, Gerard Krefft, produced the more affordable The Mammals of Australia (1871); intended for educational purposes and influenced by Gould's illustrations. Gracius Broinowski's abandoned work, Birds and Mammals of Australia (1884), so closely imitated the plates that an injunction was threatened by its publisher.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMammals of Australia / National Library of Australia collection copy of the published work\nNational Library of Australia collection copy of key plates (or pattern plates) - digitised\nIntroduction to The Mammals of Australia / National Library of Australia collection copy",

            "The Patrologia Graeca (PG, or Patrologiae Cursus Completus, Series Graeca) is an edited collection of writings by the Church Fathers and various secular writers, in the Greek language. It consists of 161 volumes produced in 1857\u20131866 by J.P. Migne's Imprimerie Catholique, Paris.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Patrologia Graeca is an edited collection of writings by the Church Fathers and various secular writers, in the Greek language. It consists of 161 volumes produced in 1857\u20131866 by J. P. Migne's Imprimerie Catholique, Paris. It includes both the Eastern Fathers and those Western authors who wrote before Latin became predominant in the Western Church in the 3rd century, e.g. the early writings collectively known as the Apostolic Fathers, such as the First and Second Epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, Eusebius, Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa.\nThe 161 volumes are bound as 166 (vols. 16 and 87 being in three parts and vol. 86 in two). An important final volume, which included some supplements and a full index, was never published, as the plates were destroyed in a fire (1868) at the printer.\nThe first series contained only Latin translations of the originals (81 vols., 1856-61). The second series contains the Greek text with a Latin translation (166 vols., 1857-66). The texts are interlaced, with one column of Greek and a corresponding column on the other side of the page that is the Latin translation. Where the Greek original has been lost, as in the case of Irenaeus, the extant Greek fragments are interspersed throughout the Latin text. In one instance, the original is preserved in Syriac only and translated into Latin. Quite often, information about the author is provided, also in Latin.\nA Greek, D. Scholarios, added a half-published list of the authors and subjects, (Athens, 1879) and began a complete table of contents (Athens, 1883). In 1912, Garnier Fr\u00e8res, Paris, published a Patrologia Graeca index volume, edited by Ferdinand Cavallera.\n\n\n== List of volumes ==\nAs with the Patrologia Latina, the authors are (with a few exceptions) in chronological order, spanning the period from the earliest Christian writers to the Fall of Constantinople.\n\n\n=== Pre-Nicaean ===\nPG 1: Clement of Rome\nPG 2: Clement of Rome, Epistle of Barnabas, Hermas, Epistle to Diognetus, Anonymous Testaments of the 12 Patriarchs\nPG 3-4: Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (5th to 6th centuries), Maximus the Confessor (7th century) commentary on Pseudo-Dionysius, George Pachymeres (14th century) commentary on Pseudo-Dionysius\nPG 5: Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Melito of Sardis, Papias of Hierapolis, Apollonius of Ephesus, etc.\nPG 6: Justin Martyr, Tatian, Athenagoras of Athens, Theophilus of Antioch, Hermias philosophus\nPG 7: Irenaeus\nPG 8-9: Clement of Alexandria\nPG 10: Gregory Thaumaturgus, Pope Zephyrinus, Sextus Julius Africanus, Pope Urban I, Hippolytus of Rome, Theognostus of Alexandria, etc.\nPG 11-17: Origen\nPG 18: Methodius of Olympus, Alexander of Lycopolis, Peter of Alexandria, Theodore of Heraclea, etc.\n\n\n=== 4th century ===\nPG 19-24: Eusebius of Caesarea\nPG 25-28: Athanasius\nPG 29-32: Basil the Great\nPG 33: Cyril of Jerusalem, Apollinaris of Laodicea, Diodorus of Tarsus, Peter II Bishop of Alexandria, Timotheus Bishop of Alexandria, Isaac the ex-Jew\nPG 34: Macarius of Egypt and Macarius of Alexandria\nPG 35-37: Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil (the Minor) Bishop of Caesarea (10th century)\nPG 38: Gregory of Nazianzus, Caesarius\nPG 39: Didymus the Blind, Amphilochius Iconiensis, Nectarius\nPG 40: Egyptian Fathers: St Anthony Abbot, Pachomius, Serapion, Bishop of Thmuis, Isaias the Abbot, Orsisius, Theodorus the Abbot.

            "A children's film, or family film, is a film genre that generally relates to children in the context of home and family. Children's films are made specifically for children and not necessarily for a general audience, while family films are made for a wider appeal with a general audience in mind. Children's films come in several major genres like realism, fantasy, adventure, war, musicals, comedy, and literary adaptations.\n\n\n== Psychological aspects ==\nChildren are born with certain innate biological dispositions as a product of long evolutionary history. This provides an underlying biological framework for what may fascinate a child and also impose limitations on the same. These can be seen in certain universal features shared in children's films. According to Grodal, films like Finding Nemo (2003), Bambi (1942), or Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001) are based on certain strong emotions like fear, that lead to the activation of what Boyer and Lienard called the hazard-precaution system. This enables the brain to take precautions in case of danger. Children's films such as these explore various topics such as: attachment to parenting agency; the development of friendship; reciprocal relationships between individuals; or deal with the necessity or need in children and young people to explore and to engage in play. Thus these diverse films deal with certain aspects that are not mere social constructions, but rather emotions relevant to all children and therefore have an appeal to a wider universal audience. While cultural aspects shape how various films are created, these films refer to underlying universal aspects that are innate and biological. University of Melbourne scholar Timothy Laurie criticises the emphasis placed on children's innate psychic tendencies, noting that \"pedagogical norms have been tirelessly heaped onto children's media\", and that rather than deriving from hardwired biology, \"the quality of childhood is more likely shaped by social policy, political opportunism, pedagogical institutions, and youth-specific market segmentation\".\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nIn the United States and Europe, the idea of children's films began to gain relative prominence in the 1930s. According to Bazalgette and Staples, the term \"family film\" is essentially an American expression while \"children's film\" is considered to be a European expression. The difference between the terms can be seen in casting methods adopted by American and European films respectively. In American family films, the search for a child protagonist involves casting children who meet a specific criterion or standard for physical appearance. In contrast, European children's films look to cast children who appear \"ordinary\". Similarly, in American family films, the adult cast can be composed of well known actors or actresses in an effort to attract a wider audience, presenting narratives from an adult or parental perspective. This is shown through the casting, content of the plot, editing, and even mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. According to Bazalgette and Staples, a fine example of a family film is Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), which if it were a European children's film with a similar plot, the title would be Sis, Dad Shrunk Us, explaining that European children's films are told from the child's perspective, portraying the story through the various emotions and experiences of the child. Because of these differences, American family films are more easily marketable toward domestic and international viewing audiences while European children's films are better received domestically with limited appeal to international audiences.\n\n\n== United States ==\n\n\n=== 1930s to 1950s ===\nThe Walt Disney Company made animated adaptations of Grimms' Fairy Tales before World War II, beginning with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). The period immediately before and during World War II saw the release of three significant family films in the U.S. These were Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs by Disney, Gulliver's Travels by Fleischer Studios, and Pinocchio (1940), also by Disney. All of these were loose adaptations of literary sources.\nAfter the war, Disney continued to make animated features that could be classified as family films given the scope of its content. According to Wojcik, the most important film adaptations of children's literature in the immediate post-World War II period were the motion pictures The Diary of Anne Frank by George Stevens (1959), Treasure Island (1950) by Byron Haskin and Luigi Comencini's 1952 motion picture Heidi.\n\n\n=== 1960s to 1990s ===\nIn the 1960s, motion pictures such as To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and Oliver! (1968), directed by Carol Reed, portrayed children as naturally innocent. Other films of the 1960s that involved children include The Sound of Music (1965) by Robert Wise and The Miracle Worker (1962). These were very successful musical motion picture that were in the genre of family films. Four of the top ten highest-grossing films of the decade were family films: The Sound of Music, One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), The Jungle Book (1967), and Mary Poppins (1964). Hollywood also released motion pictures starring children though these were not commercially successful and they were literary adaptations nonetheless. These include ...And Now Miguel (1966), Doctor Dolittle (1967), and The Learning Tree (1969). Other family/children films of the decade include Pollyanna (1960), Swiss Family Robinson (1960), In Search of the Castaways (1962), The Sword in the Stone (1963), That Darn Cat! (1965), Up the Down Staircase (1967), To Sir, With Love (1967), Yours, Mine and Ours (1968), and The Parent Trap (1961).\nChildren's films in the 1970s from the United States include animated films such as The Aristocats (1970), Charlotte's Web (1973), Robin Hood (1973), The Rescuers (1977), and The Hobbit (1977). The decade also had live action children's films like Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), Sounder (1972), Benji (1974), Tuck Everlasting (1976), The Bad News Bears (1976), Freaky Friday (1976), and A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich (1978), the divorce drama involving a child Kramer vs. Kramer (1978), and The Muppet Movie (1979). There were also combination live action/animation films such as 1971's Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Pete's Dragon (1977). This trend of films inspired the 1980s and 1990s productions of classic children's films from America including Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Matilda (1996).\nAmerican children's and family films of the 1980s include Popeye (1980), The Fox and the Hound (1981), Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Great Mouse Detective (1986), and The Little Mermaid (1989). Spielberg portrays children realistically, having to cope with issues. This is seen in E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, where the children have to cope with the issues of single parenting and divorce, as well as separation from their father. Also, in the motion picture Empire of the Sun (1987), the protagonist child Jim Graham has to deal with separation from his parents for years, to the point where he is unable to even remember what his mother looked like. He is wounded not by bullets, but by the madness and cruelty of war and separation from his parents. According to Robin Wood, in their films, Lucas and Spielberg both reconstruct \"... the adult spectator as a child ...\" or \"... an adult who would like to be a child\". Other important children's films from the U.S. in the late 1970s include Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Live action films like Superman (1978) and Superman II are also important children's and family films. They have been ranked as some of the best family entertainment over the past generation. The 1970s and 1980s also include several films and their sequels as classics of family films, including: Star Wars (1977) and its sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Other similar movies and sequels include Robert Zemeckis's film Back to the Future (1985) and its sequels Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).\n\"Since the resurgence of Disney feature films with The Little Mermaid (1989)\", writes Laurie, \"high-budget animations have become part of the Hollywood box office furniture, with phenomenal successes from Pixar Studios, DreamWorks animations and more recently, Blue Sky Studios\". Important animated family films of the 1990s include Disney titles such as Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), The Lion King (1994), Mulan (1998), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), and the Pixar animated films Toy Story (1995), its sequel Toy Story 2 (1999), and A Bug's Life (1998). This decade introduced the modern fairy tale film Edward Scissorhands (1990), depicting an isolated, artificially created young man with human emotions and childlike qualities who is ultimately rejected by society while the female protagonist holds on to his memory. The 1990s also saw additional live-action family films such as Back to the Future Part III (1990), which brought the Back to the Future franchise into this decade, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Home Alone (1990) and its sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Hook (1991), Alan & Naomi (1992), Jurassic Park (1993), Steve Zaillian's Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), Super Mario Bros. (1993), Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), The Flintstones (1994), Babe (1995), Jumanji (1995), 101 Dalmatians (1996), Fly Away Home (1996), Vegas Vacation (1997), and October Sky (1999). Films such as A Little Princess (1995) were more successful in the home video market than in theaters. Direct-to-video became important for both animated and live-action films, such as The Return of Jafar (1994), and those starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.\n\n\n== Europe ==\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, a children's film studio was set up in Moscow. Several films were imported from this studio to the United Kingdom including The Magic Fish, The Land of Toys, and The Humpbacked Horse. Post World War II children's films include the Italian neorealist film Bicycle Thieves, by Vittorio De Sica (1948). According to Goldstein and Zornow, Clement's French film, Forbidden Games (1952), features children in the scenario of war, and shows the gap between children and adults. This period also includes the Czech children's film Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955), directed by Karel Zeman. In the 1960s, important European children's films include the British-Italian romance film Romeo and Juliet (1968), and the French film L'Enfant sauvage (1969). French film directors Louis Malle and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut made significant contributions to children's films. Louis Malle made the films Zazie dans le M\u00e9tro (1960), Murmur of the Heart (1971), and Pretty Baby (1978). The works of Truffaut include The 400 Blows (1959), The Wild Child (1970) and Small Change (1976). The film making style of Malle and Truffaunt inspired present day directors in making children's films; including Ponette (1996) directed by Jacques Doillon, which deals with the emotional and psychological pain and hurt that children experience \"... while living without parental love and care\". Other important European children's cinema in the 1960s include The Christmas Tree (1969), which tells the story of a child coping with his imminent death due to leukemia, and Robert Bresson's film Mouchette (1964), which deals with the suicide of a 14-year-old girl. According to Wojcik, the contrast between films like Mary Poppins and Mouchette shows the ambiguous or schizoid nature of the depiction of children in the 1960s.\nEuropean children's films from the 1970s and 1980s include: the German film directed by Wim Wenders, Alice in den St\u00e4dten (1974); the Spanish film The Spirit of the Beehive (1973); Fanny & Alexander directed by Ingmar Bergman; the Danish film Pelle the Conqueror (1988); The NeverEnding Story (1984), directed by German director Wolfgang Petersen; the Danish film, Me and Mamma Mia (1989); and the Hungarian film Love, Mother (1987). Autumn Sonata by Ingmar Bergman is also an important cinema in the genre of family films, although it deals with issues between parent and child which the child expresses after reaching adulthood. The 1990s include the important Russian films Burnt by the Sun (1994) and The Thief (1997), both of which are set in post-revolutionary Russia of 1917. In the 2000s, important European children's films include the Finnish film Mother of Mine (2005), the Italian short film Il supplente (\"The Substitute\") (2007), and the Polish animated film Peter and the Wolf (2006). In 2010s the Belgian, French language film, The Kid with a Bike (2011) stands as an important children's film.\n\n\n=== Britain ===\nIn the 1960s, the UK made motion pictures dealing with children that are now regarded as classics. These films include The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), Lord of the Flies (1963), Born Free (1966), To Sir, with Love (1967) (based on E. R. Braithwaite's real experiences), and if.... (1968). The list also includes the film Kes (1969). Some children's motion pictures belong to the category of avant-garde films because of the unconventional and often controversial treatment of the subject. According to film scholars; an important example of an avant-garde children's film is the British film Pink Floyd The Wall (1982). Pink Floyd The Wall is an unconventional and controversial motion picture that has a haunting and powerful nightmarish depiction of alienated childhood, boarding school separation, maternal deprivation, separation anxiety, war, and consumerist greed that affects a child and further affects his relationships and experiences in adulthood. It shows the child with non traditional images and the social changes that has occurred with family. In Pink Floyd The Wall the representation of child and family \"stresses confrontation, confusion, dysfunctionality and history\".\n\n\n== Asia ==\nIn the 1960s, important children's films from Japan include Bad Boys (1960), based on the lives of children in a reform school for juvenile delinquents, and Boy (1969). In the 1960s, important children's films from Asia include the film Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) by Satyajit Ray. South India gave us the children's film Daisy (1988), depicting children in a boarding school and their experience of separation and longing. Other children's films from this region also include Abhayam (1991), which is also known by the alternative title, Shelter, by Sivan. It was awarded the Silver Elephant and Special International Jury & CIFEJ Jury Awards at the 7th International Children's Film Festival. India also has a neo-realist children's film about street children in Mumbai, Salaam Bombay (1988) by Mira Nair. It depicts the cruel way in which adults treat children in India by showing the hard life of street children in Mumbai (also called as Bombay). Important children's films from India also include the Bollywood films Masoom (1983) and Mr. India (1987); both directed by Shekhar Kapoor. Other important children's films include the reproduction of the German Fairy tales of the Grimm brothers by the Israeli film companies Golan Globus and Cannon Films in their series called Cannon Movie Tales, which includes: The Frog Prince (1986), starring Aileen Quinn, Helen Hunt, and John Paragon; Beauty and the Beast (1987), starring John Savage; and Puss in Boots (1988), starring Christopher Walken. From Japan, Miyazaki's Spirited Away was voted as the number one film that must be seen by 14 years of age. That list also included the M\u0101ori film Whale Rider (2002). Another important children's film is Son of Maryam (1998), directed by Hamid Jebeli and set in Azerbaijan. It deals with the relationship between a Muslim boy and an Armenian priest.\n\n\n== South Africa, Canada and Argentina ==\nChildren's films from South Africa include Tsotsi (2006).

            "Bleeding Steel is a 2017 Chinese science fiction cyberpunk action film directed and written by Leo Zhang and starring Jackie Chan.\nBleeding Steel was released in China on 22 December 2017. In the US, Lionsgate Premiere released the film in theaters and on VOD on 6 July 2018. The film received mixed reviews and it grossed US$48.8 million and was a box office bomb.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile racing to the hospital to see his daughter Xixi, who has leukemia and whose condition has become critical, Hong Kong Special Agent Lin Dong is informed by his colleague Xiao Su that Dr. James, an important witness, is in danger. Lin stops right outside the hospital, hesitates, and drives off to meet up with Xiao Su and their unit.\nBefore the unit arrives, Dr. James injects himself with a chemical substance and brings along a mechanical heart with him. As the unit escorts him away, they are ambushed by a squad of men in exotic black armor and high-tech weaponry led by a monstrous-looking man named Andre, who kills off most of the unit and severely injures Lin Dong and Xiao Su. Before Andre can capture Dr. James, Lin Dong pins him against an oil tank using his car. When Andre survives the car's impact, Lin shoots the oil tank, causing a huge explosion. As he lies gravely injured, Lin receives a phone call that Dr. James answers: Xixi has died at the hospital. However both Lin Dong and Andre are later shown to have survived, although Andre's injuries have him turned into a cyborg.\n13 years later in Sydney, Australia, author Rick Rogers has recently released a book titled Bleeding Steel about a US Marine implanted with a mechanical heart. A young man named Li Sen, disguised as a female prostitute, pays a visit to Rogers at his hotel, drugs him, and downloads information about the book from his computer. A black-clad woman storms the building and tortures Rogers to reveal the source of his inspiration for the book. While Li Sen hides in the suite's bathtub, the Woman in Black is attacked by Lin Dong, who has also come to find out the same answer. Rogers is killed by the Woman in Black, and the arrival of the police forces everyone to retreat.\nThe Woman in Black returns to a high-tech airship that serves as Andre's headquarters and briefs him about the failed operation. He identifies Lin Dong and Li Sen from CCTV footage and sends the Woman after the latter, but Li Sen has already fled. Acting upon the data he had taken from Rogers, Li Sen tracks down Nancy, a young woman who is plagued by nightmares about a laboratory where strange experiments were conducted. In order to deal with them, she has been visiting a spiritualist, who in turn told Rogers about the dreams. She is tracked down by the Woman in Black, but is rescued and taken to safety by Lin Dong and Li Sen's combined efforts.\nNancy is revealed to be Xixi, resurrected by Dr. James, who had been working on the genetic enhancement of human beings, and specifically regeneration, to create immortal bioroid soldiers. James fitted Xixi with the mechanical heart and infused her with the chemical substance he had injected himself with, a biogenetic blood substitute, which gave her regenerative abilities. However, Xixi's temporary death had left her with amnesia, and she was put into an orphanage for her own safety, while Lin Dong and his old unit secretly watched over her. Her nightmares stem from James' memories which imprinted themselves on the blood substitute he had injected himself with, and his blood was afterwards used in her resurrection. Andre, a former special forces soldier, was another test subject who infiltrated the project in the service of a prominent Korean arms dealer who wanted to steal James' research and use it for profit. The procedure failed on Andre, leaving his cells to slowly consume him from within, and in revenge he killed the arms dealer and his family. James himself died soon after his operation on Xixi, making her the sole successful subject of his achievements.\nLin Dong takes Xixi and Li Sen to his house, where he locks the young man in his advanced security vault and pays a visit to the spiritualist, who he finds murdered. Xixi runs away to take a flight back to James' abandoned home, where she recovers both her old memories of her father and a bank vault key hidden by James. Following her, Lin Dong reunites with Xiao Su, but before he can reach Xixi, she is kidnapped by the Woman in Black and is brought to Andre's airship and imprisoned in his laboratory. Rejoined by Li Sen, who had managed to free himself, they proceed to the bank vault, where the Woman in Black has been captured by Xiao Su while trying to retrieve the vault's contents: a video camera. Examining the contents of the camera's tape, which details Andre's botched bioroid conversion, Lin and Xiao Su surmise that Andre is dying and he needs Xixi's blood to bestow the regenerative effect upon himself to survive.\nOnboard Andre's airship, Andre proceeds to extract Xixi's blood and inject it into himself to restore his body. Lin Dong, Xiao Su, and Li Sen infiltrate the craft and try to break Xixi out but are thwarted by an impenetrable security screen. The trio battle Andre's henchmen, which forces him to join the fight before the transfusion is complete, which gives Xixi sufficient time to fully regenerate and come to her father's aid. Lin and the others cast Andre into the airship's reactor core, which overloads and destroys the lab, but Li Sen is caught in an explosion. Xiao Su and Xixi manage to escape the airship by parachute, but Lin Dong is attacked by Andre before he can join them. Because Andre had accidentally injected Lin Dong with Xixi's enhanced blood during their earlier encounter, Lin Dong gains enough strength to fight him off and rips Andre's heart out of his chest. Without a parachute, Lin jumps off the airship before a final explosion destroys the craft, killing Andre, but Xiao Su and Xixi catch him using their own chute's canopy.\nIn the aftermath, as Lin Dong, Xixi and Xiao enjoy time together, Lin learns from his colleague that Li Sen was the son of the arms dealer who had sought James' research, and for years he had planned to take revenge on Andre for the murder of his family. Lin also realizes that Li had been a friend of Nancy/Xixi at the orphanage and had acted out of genuine affection for her. In Norway, Li Sen is shown to have survived, offering the tape with James' research to a interested buyer where he then refuses the buyer's offer.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJackie Chan as Lin Dong\nCallan Mulvey as Andre\nShow Lo as Li Sen\nOuyang Nana as Nancy/Xixi\nTess Haubrich as Woman in Black\nErica Xia-hou as Xiao Su (Susan)\nKym Gyngell as Dr James\nDamien Garvey as Rick Rogers\nGillian Jones as Witch\nCosentino as himself\n\n\n== Production ==\nVillage Roadshow Pictures Asia and Heyi Pictures co-produced and co-financed the sci-fi thriller film, Bleeding Steel, starring Jackie Chan, directed by Leo Zhang from his own script. Other cast included Tess Haubrich, Callan Mulvey, Nana Ou-Yang, Erica Xia-Hou, and Show Lo.\nPrincipal photography on the film began on 20 July 2016, in Sydney, Australia. Filming also took place in Taipei and Beijing, and wrapped up in September 2016.\n\n\n== Release ==\nBleeding Steel was first released in Australia by Perfect Village Entertainment on 15 December 2017 before being released in China by United Entertainment Partners (UEP) a week later, on 22 December. The film was released in the Philippines by Viva International Pictures and MVP Entertainment on 21 February 2018. In the United States, the film was first released by UEP with English subtitles in December 2017. It was later released with an English dub by Lionsgate Premiere on 6 July 2018 in both theaters and video on demand.\nBleeding Steel, though not officially part of the Police Story series, was released under the title \u30dd\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc REBORN (lit. Police Story Reborn) in Japan, and used an updated version of the Police Story title song sung by Jackie Chan in the end credits. Unlike the original, which was sung in Cantonese, this version is sung in Mandarin Chinese.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 22% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The South China Morning Post compared Bleeding Steel to previous films starring Jackie Chan, stating \"with this one he hits a new low in terms of the nonsensical garbage he is willing to put his name to\". The review specifically noted the lack of \"action, humour or logic\", finding the film \"packed with risible English dialogue and even worse performances, the film feels like a lazy, contemptuous cash grab from start to finish\". Variety declared the film a \"corny cyberpunk pastiche\" that would appeal \"exclusively to kids\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBleeding Steel at IMDb\nBleeding Steel at the Hong Kong Movie DataBase",
            "Stealth is a 2005 American military science fiction action film directed by Rob Cohen and written by W. D. Richter, and starring Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx, Sam Shepard, Joe Morton and Richard Roxburgh. The film follows three top fighter pilots as they join a project to develop an automated robotic stealth aircraft.\nReleased on July 29, 2005, by Columbia Pictures, the film was a critical and box office failure, grossing $79.3 million worldwide against a budget of $135 million. It was one of the worst losses in cinematic history.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the near future, the U.S. Navy develops the F/A-37 Talon, a single-seat fighter-bomber with advanced payload, range, speed, and stealth capabilities. The program recruits three pilots out of 400 applicants; Lieutenants Ben Gannon, Kara Wade, and Henry Purcell. Captain George Cummings is the overall head.\nTo further advances the program, Cummings has an artificial intelligence, the \"Extreme Deep Invader\" (EDI), installed on an uncrewed jet. EDI joins the others on the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Philippine Sea to learn combat maneuvers from the pilots. This sparks controversy over a machine's inability to make moral decisions versus humans' struggle to overcome ego.\nWhilst training EDI in air combat maneuvers, the team is unexpectedly reassigned to kill the heads of three terrorist cells at a conference in downtown Rangoon. According to EDI calculation, minimum casualty can be achieved by a vertical missile strike augmented by the bomber diving at a speed sufficient to cause a human pilot to black out. Command authorizes EDI to attack, but Gannon defies orders and carries out the strike himself, blacking out and regaining consciousness just in time to avoid crashing. As the team returns to the Lincoln, EDI is hit by lightning. Subsequent inspection of EDI reveals an accelerated learning pace and development of a rudimentary ethical code and an ego, which might lead to unpredictable behaviors, but Cummings refuses to take EDI offline. \nDuring a mission to destroy stolen nuclear warheads in Tajikistan, Wade realizes that the fallout will cause significant collateral damage. The human pilots abort, but EDI defies orders and destroys the warheads, causing extensive radioactive fallout and civilian casualties as anticipated. After EDI refuses order to return to base, an agitated Gannon decides to shoot it down. In the ensuing dogfight, a missile Purcell fires at EDI explodes on a mountain, blinding him and causing a fatal crash. Wade's plane is damaged by the same explosion, which triggers her plane's auto-destruct, forcing her to eject over North Korea. \nCommand realizes EDI is executing a 20-year-old war scenario called Caviar Sweep that involves attacking Russia. Gannon chases EDI into Russian territory where they destroy several Russian Su-37s. After both planes are damaged, Gannon calls a truce with EDI to avoid falling into enemy hands and rescue Wade. Cummings instructs the two to land in Alaska. \nAt risk of facing court-martial for ignoring EDI's behavior, Cummings seeks to eliminate witnesses. He ignores Wade, who heads to the Korean Demilitarized Zone \u2013  while evading the army. Cummings orders Gannon eliminated, and orders Dr. Keith Orbit, EDI's creator, to Alaska to wipe EDI's memory.\nAt the Alaska base, suspecting Cummings' treachery, Gannon narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by the base's doctor and kills him. Meanwhile, while Orbit inspects EDI, the AI expresses regret for its transgressions. Realizing EDI has developed sentience, Orbit decides against to erase its memory, against Cummings order. Orbit reinstalls EDI and Gannon climbs in the same plane as his was damaged during landing. Gannon uses EDI's weapons systems to clear a path for Orbit to flee, then flies to North Korea. Gannon contacts the Lincoln's skipper, Captain Dick Marshfield, to inform him about Cummings' deceit. Before Marshfield can confront him, Cummings commits suicide.\nGannon finds the injured and embattled Wade nearing the border. He lands and runs to her aid. Out of ammunition and taking damage from a Mi-8 helicopter, EDI sacrifices itself by ramming the helicopter, destroying both. Gannon and Wade to cross on foot into South Korea, where they are rescued.\nAfter attending Purcell's funeral, Gannon awkwardly expresses his feelings of love to Wade.\nIn a post-credits scene, in the debris-strewn border between North and South Korea, EDI's \"brain\" is seen turning back on.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJosh Lucas as Lt. Ben Gannon, US Navy pilot part of the F/A-37 program\nJessica Biel as Kara Wade, 2nd US Navy pilot part of the F/A-37 program\nJamie Foxx as Henry Purcell, 3rd US Navy pilot part of the F/A-37 program\nSam Shepard as Capt. George Cummings, leader and founder of the F/A-37 program\nJoe Morton as Capt. Dick Marshfield, captain of the USS Abraham Lincoln\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as Tim\nRichard Roxburgh as Dr. Keith Orbit, the creator of EDI\nDavid Andrews as Ray, financial contact of George Cummings\nWentworth Miller as voice of EDI, an uncrewed, AI jet\nMichael Denkha as Naval Controller\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn August 2002, it was announced Columbia Pictures had picked up Warrior, a W.D. Richter spec script set up at Phoenix Pictures about a high- tech air force fighter drone that malfunctions, wiping out the better part of a crewed elite squadron. Vastly overmatched, a single pilot must attempt to destroy the drone. In November of that year Rob Cohen entered negotiations to direct.\nStealth features several shots of action on aircraft carriers. Scenes featuring the cast were shot on board the US Navy aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, while additional scenes were shot on board the similar Nimitz and Carl Vinson.\nThe film was shot in Thailand, Australia (Blue Mountains National Park in New South Wales and Flinders Ranges in South Australia), and New Zealand. Cohen cited Macross as an inspiration for the film.\n\n\n== Litigation ==\nIn March 2005, Leo Stoller, who claimed to own trademark rights to the word \"stealth\", served Columbia Pictures with a \"cease and desist\" letter threatening litigation if they did not rename the film to something \"non infringing\".  Columbia preemptively sued Stoller, and the court entered a consent judgment and permanent injunction in favor of Columbia Pictures and against Stoller in November 2005.\nThe Environmental Defender's Office, a community legal centre specialising in environmental law, successfully represented the Blue Mountains Conservation Society Inc. in its attempts to prevent filming of Stealth in the Grose Valley wilderness area of the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW, Australia, in May 2004. Justice Lloyd of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court ruled that the proposed commercial filming of scenes in the area was unlawful, in a significant statement on the value of wilderness areas and the protection that should be afforded to them.  The Society claimed that the authority and consent for the commercial filming activities were in breach of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 and the Wilderness Act 1987. Justice Lloyd accepted the Society's arguments that the proposed commercial filming in a wilderness area was completely against the intended use of the land, concluding his judgment with the words, \"wilderness is sacrosanct\".\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nThe soundtrack was released on 12 July 2005 on Epic Records. American rock band Incubus wrote and recorded three new songs for the film. According to guitarist Mike Einziger, Cohen was a big fan and \"wouldn't stop asking.\" It was the first time the band had composed original music for a soundtrack, with frontman Brandon Boyd citing \"Princes of the Universe\" by Queen as an inspiration for writing music for a film. \"Neither of Us Can See\" is also notable for being Incubus' first duet, featuring vocals from Chrissie Hynde. The song is featured in the end credits.\nOne song from the album, \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\" by the Colorado band The Fray (who is just recently signed to Epic) became a massively successful hit song, charted at number 8 on the billboard hot 100, became the fifth most-downloaded single of 2006, nominated for a Grammy, and helped launching the band into superstardom.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film cost $135 million to produce (excluding advertising costs) and was released in  3,495 theaters, but had an opening weekend of only $13.3 million for an average of only $3,792 per theater, peaking at 4th place behind Wedding Crashers, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Sky High. It then lost 55% of its audience in its second weekend dropping to 7th place to $5.9 million, while remaining at 3,495 theaters and averaging just $1,695 per theater. In its third weekend, it lost 1,455 theaters, and a further 64 percent of its audience, dropping to 11th, with just $2.2 million, for an average of just $1,055 from 2,040 theaters.\nIt ended up making $32.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $47.2 million internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $79.3 million, making it the biggest money loser in a series of financial disasters released by Columbia Pictures in 2005 next to XXX: State of the Union, Bewitched, Rent, Zathura, Into the Blue, Man of the House and Lords of Dogtown.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 13% based on 140 reviews, with an average rating of 3.74/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Loud, preposterous, and predictable, Stealth borrows heavily and unsuccessfully from Top Gun and 2001.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 31 critics,  indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"B\u2212\" on scale of A to F.\nRoger Ebert commented that the film was \"a dumbed-down Top Gun crossed with the HAL 9000 plot from 2001.\"\nLater director Rob Cohen unfavorably compared Stealth to his two previous box-office hits, The Fast and the Furious and XxX: \u201cFast And Furious can be what it is as a story, but in the end, it was a fun Summer ride; XxX was a fun Summer ride\u2026 And Stealth was not fun. It was not as entertaining moment-to-moment as the other two had been, and what I think you need for a movie in the Summer.\u201c\n\n\n== See also ==\nIntelligent Fly-by-Wire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nStealth at IMDb\nStealth at the TCM Movie Database\nStealth at AllMovie\nStealth at Box Office Mojo\nMaritimequest Filming Stealth photo gallery\n\"The science of Stealth\".

He befriends the next door neighbor, Patrice (\"The Lamest Place in the World\"), and her friend Archie, who uses a wheelchair.\nFaced with his upcoming Bar Mitzvah, Evan aims to befriend the popular kids at his new school, led by football star Brett Sampson and head cheerleader, Kendra Duncan, but this alienates him from Patrice, who is considered a dork by the popular kids and sees Evan wanting to befriend them as a betrayal. Things aren't better at home, with Evan resenting both his parents for the divorce and move and his mother Jessica lamenting giving up her writing career for her marriage, only for it to fail anyway.\nBrett and Kendra are crushing on each other and want to share their first kiss together (\"I've Been Waiting\"), but Kendra's best friend Lucy Hallman also likes Brett, and is fed up with always being outshone by Kendra (\"Opportunity\"). When Evan comes up with a plan to trick Kendra's overbearing mother and get her and Brett on a date to the movies (\"The Bloodmaster\"), Lucy threatens him to prevent the two from kissing or she will get everyone to boycott Evan's party.\nTo prevent the kiss without angering Brett directly, Evan recruits Archie, who has a huge crush on Kendra, to sit next to her at the movies to ruin the mood. Archie is fine with this, despite knowing Evan is using him (\"Getting Ready\"), but Patrice learns and calls Kendra's mother with the truth, causing her to storm in and ruin the date.  This backfires on her when such an act alienates her from both Archie and Evan, who is blamed and shunned. Lucy makes her move and kisses Brett, claiming him as her boyfriend.\nLucy proves to be a clingy overbearing girlfriend to Brett, whose friends pity his sad state (\"Bad Bad News\"). Evan and Jessica reconcile over the disappointing turns their lives have taken (\"It Would Be Funny\"), and Evan finally calls his father, who apologizes and encourages him to fix his mistakes. He convinces Brett to apologize to Kendra, with help from Patrice (\"Tell Her\").  Brett and Kendra reconcile, and he dumps Lucy.  Evan and Patrice apologize to each other, and Evan asks her to come to his Bar Mitzvah.\nThe morning of the party, Patrice is convinced to forgive Evan by a gift Evan leaves at her house, and goes to the service, which is also attended by Brett and Kendra and their friends, including Lucy, who apologizes and makes up with Kendra. Evan completes his service, and everyone sings that they have \"A Little More Homework to Do\" while flashes show Jessica and Evan moving into a house of their own, Evan being friends with both Brett and Kendra, and Patrice and Archie with understanding on both sides, Jessica resuming her writing career, and Archie getting a new crush.

            "Abby in Wonderland is a 2008 American musical fantasy film that adapts Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland with the Muppets of Sesame Street. Abby Cadabby stars in the role of Alice. The feature-length adventure was released on DVD by Genius Products on September 30, 2008. In addition to receiving a DVD release, the film received a limited theatrical run in September 2008 through the Kidtoons family matinee series, and was aired on PBS Kids Feast of Favorites during the week of Thanksgiving 2008. It was aired again on December 29, 2008 on local PBS stations.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAbby wants very much to be in her own fairy tale. Elmo takes an interest in Abby's wish and tells her the story of \"Alice in Wonderland\". For a second Abby falls asleep and she opens her eyes to see that she is wearing a blue dress and blouse and Elmo has turned into a rabbit and is in a great hurry.\nAbby follows Mr. Rabbit down a tunnel. At the bottom, she loses her wand to Mr. Rabbit, who disappears at the end of the tunnel. Abby notices there is a small door, but it\u2019s locked. She finds the key to the door on a table that just appeared. She unlocks the door, but she's too big to fit through the little door. With that she closes, locks the door and puts the key back on the table. Then Abby notices there is a bottle that just appeared. Before Abby can drink it, the bottle tells her not to drink him, but say things that rhyme with 'drink'. Abby does and she shrinks to the right size to go through the door, but she recalls she locked it and left the key on the table, where it is out of her reach. Abby finds a cookie who tells her to say things that rhyme with 'eat'. Abby says so many rhymes, she grows pretty big, but she manages to balance her size, grab the key and shrink herself to a small size. Abby takes Bottle and Cookie with her as she unlocks the door and enters a flowerbed.\nFurther in the flowerbed, Abby meets the Counterpillar (played by Count von Count) and his partner Little Rose-ita (played by Rosita), but does not want to join in their counting game. With Cookie's help, Abby restores herself to her regular size. Just then Mr. Rabbit rushes past and Abby runs after him, passing Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum (played by Bert and Ernie, respectively), whom the former tells the latter that they are actually not in this story. Abby bumps into a tree and meets the Cheshire Cookie Cat (played by Cookie Monster), who points her in the direction of a tea party.\nAt the tea party, Abby meets the Mad Hatter (played by Grover), Mr. Rabbit and Mousie (played by Zoe). To Abby's surprise, the Hatter doesn't serve tea, but letters 'T' in the cups. The Hatter shows Abby his collection of hats. After that Abby asks Mr. Rabbit for her wand, but with the hole in his pocket, he dropped it somewhere. The Cheshire Cookie Cat appears, guzzles up all the scones and cookies and scares away Mousie.\nAbby walks down a path in the search for her wand until she sees the path forks into four directions. As Mr. Rabbit comes to talk with Abby, she sits down in despair of being lost in this wonderland. Soon Mr. Rabbit rushes off to attend the King's Croquet Game. Abby follows him and finds a door in a tree. The door takes her to the messy castle of the king, \"The Grouch of Cards\" (played by Oscar the Grouch). The king has Abby's wand thinking it's a new royal scepter. Abby tries to retrieve her wand, challenging the king to a game of croquet, but he cheats. Mr. Rabbit protests at the king's decision to keep the wand. Before his grouchlings can throw out Abby and Mr. Rabbit, they both use Cookie to grow large. They scare the grouchlings and the king away. Once Abby and Mr. Rabbit restore themselves to their original size, Abby reclaims her wand. Abby is unable to magic herself back home, but Mr. Rabbit reminds her she's still dreaming.\nBack in Sesame Street, Elmo shakes Abby awake. Although Abby sort of got her wish to be in a fairy tale, she thinks she's better off being in a fairy tale when she's a little older.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLeslie Carrara as Abby Cadabby/herself\nKevin Clash as Elmo/Red Rabbit\nJerry Nelson as the Counter-pillar (Count von Count)\nCaroll Spinney as the Grouch of Hearts (Oscar the Grouch)\nDavid Rudman as the Cheshire Cookie Cat (Cookie Monster)\nFran Brill as Zoe/Mousey the Hatter Helper\nTyler Bunch as Bottle\nRickey Boyd as Cookie\nEric Jacobson as Grover/Mad Hatter and Tweedledee (Bert)\nCarmen Osbahr as Rosita/Little Rose\nSteve Whitmire as Tweedledum (Ernie)\nAdditional Muppets performed by Pam Arciero, John Kennedy, Peter Linz, Paul McGinnis, Martin P. Robinson, David Stephens, and Matt Vogel.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDVD Verdict gave the film a positive review, noting that while the original Alice in Wonderland story \"kooky and fanciful, but also a little creepy\", the Sesame Street version was sanitized for its target audience by polishing the original's \"rough edges\" and \"removing any real sense of danger.\" They further noted that there is a place for some scary children's tales, but not on Sesame Street. While the film is targeted to a very young audience, some of the jokes are for adults. An example given is on how Ernie explains to Bert \"that, despite popular misconception,\" the characters of Tweedledum and Tweedledee are \"not actually in this story\".  It was noted that while the songs written by Mark Radice are bright and fun, \"they don't quite live up to the best tunes Sesame Street has to offer.\"   It was concluded \"There are a lot of bad remakes of Alice in Wonderland. This isn't one of them.\"\nCommon Sense Media gave it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAbby in Wonderland at Internet Movie Database\nAbby in Wonderland at Rotten Tomatoes\nAbby in Wonderland at AllMovie",
            "Addams Family Reunion is a 1998 American comedy horror film based on the characters from the cartoon created by cartoonist Charles Addams. It is the sequel to The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993). Directed by Dave Payne, the film was intended to serve as a pilot for a new proposed television series produced by Saban. The film stars Daryl Hannah and Tim Curry as Morticia and Gomez Addams respectively while Carel Struycken and Christopher Hart's hand are the only ones to reprise their roles from the last two films. The film's plot focused on the eccentric, macabre aristocratic Addams family mistakenly arriving at the wrong family reunion and encountering a man (Ed Begley Jr.) who seeks to commit murder in order to inherit a fortune.\nPayne had intended to give the film a dark, edgy tone, but Saban had interfered with the development, insisting that the story be aimed solely at entertaining children, and lack much of the black comedy and satire of the previous films. Saban also wanted Payne to imitate aspects of Paramount Pictures' popular 1991\u201393 duo of films, and the 1964 TV series, and rejected any original idea developed by Payne and the film's screenwriters. As a result, the film was poorly received by critics, who criticized the film's screenplay, special effects, production design, and much of its acting, while singling out Tim Curry's performance for praise, calling Curry the best part of the film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDiscovering that his grandparents have developed \"Waltzheimer's disease\", a disease that is slowly turning them \"normal\", Gomez plans a family reunion, hoping that some branch of his enormous family tree will find a cure. However, Gomez sends a card written in blood, which damages the machines of the company organizing the reunion and results in the Addams receiving the wrong invitation.\nGomez, Morticia, Fester, Lurch, and the grandparents drive to a luxury resort for the family reunion. Gomez meets psychiatrist Dr. Philip Adams, who plans to poison his wealthy father Walter Adams and rearrange his will. Gomez hopes that Dr. Adams can cure his grandparents. Philip's sister, Katherine Adams, is aware what Philip is doing and wants a piece of Walter's wealth and threatens Philip if he doesn't give her the share of the wealth.\nPhilip's brother and his wife, who are headed to the reunion, are given the wrong address and end up in the Addams family mansion, where Granny and Cousin Itt are staying. They stay there as guests, but are increasingly abused by their hosts. Granny learns that the wife is vegetarian, so she feeds her with a plant: deadly nightshade. Cousin Itt plays poker with the husband, and wins over most of the man's fortune.\nPugsley falls in love with Gina Adams, a young bespectacled girl. Wednesday antagonizes two of her new snobby \"cousins\", children of Philip. Lurch saves Gina's mother from drowning in the swimming pool. He falls in love with the woman, while she is disgusted with him. Walter Adams expresses his hatred for his son and most of his family. Fester and Thing do their best to capture Butcher, Fester's mutated puppy who feeds on human hair.\nPhilip initially refuses to help Gomez in any way, but agrees to a bet. If he beats Gomez in a game, he will earn thousands of dollars. If Gomez wins, Philip will offer his services to him. Philip is overconfident, as he is a champion in many games. But Gomez easily defeats him in successive challenges, in the games of darts, table tennis, and tennis. Philip is publicly humiliated in the process.\nInstead of offering his services as previously agreed, an enraged Philip attacks Gomez in public. They have a knife fight, which Gomez eventually wins. While Gomez holds his knife to Philip's throat, the police arrive. Gomez and Morticia are arrested for attempted murder, Pugsley and Wednesday are arrested for digging open the grave of the resort's founders. Fester is considered insane and becomes a mental patient, while Butcher and Thing are captured by a sadistic dog catcher. Lurch has been buried alive by Wednesday and is unable to escape.\nPugsley and Wednesday are taken in by child services, Katherine secretly called child services to get rid of the Addams so no one can stand in her and Philip's way of getting wealthy, and placed in foster care with Philip's wife. Meanwhile, Philip gains custody over Fester and tortures him with an electric chair. He has previously used this chair to torture other patients. The dog-catcher plans to feed Thing to one of his dogs. Gomez and Morticia are unable to escape a police cell.\nWalter Adams has taken a liking to Gomez, and posts bail for him and Morticia. He helps them rescue Lurch, who then helps rescue the rest of the family. Pugsley and Wednesday were in the process of torturing their foster family, but are happily reunited with their parents. The Addams Family strap Philip in his own electric chair, and have him tortured by his patients.\nThe Addams Family eventually return to their mansion, and leave their increasingly \"normal\" grandparents in the care of Philip's wife. Walter Adams bids farewell to the Addams and leaves for California and cutting ties to his Adams family. Wednesday amuses herself with lighting fireworks, while Pugsley seems melancholic. Gomez asks him if he misses Gina, but Pugsley is instead sad because he forgot his \"Siberian firecracker\" back at the foster family's house.\nAt this point, the \"firecracker\" is revealed to have been a nuclear weapon and the Addams Family witness a distant nuclear explosion apparently caused by it. Morticia comments that a nuclear winter is swiftly approaching and that she feels gloomy. Gomez and Morticia kiss, finishing the film.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nFollowing the success of the theatrically released films The Addams Family, released in 1991 and its 1993 sequel, Addams Family Values, Saban negotiated to purchase the home video production rights to the Addams Family brand in order to take advantage of the direct-to-video market. Because of the underwhelming commercial performance of Addams Family Values, as well as the death of Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, who had played Gomez Addams, Paramount Pictures ultimately decided not to produce a third film, resulting in Saban deciding to reboot the series.\nAddams Family Reunion was co-produced by Saban with Warner Bros. The two studios planned to produce a new series called The New Addams Family, and intended to produce a two-hour pilot film for the series, which eventually became Addams Family Reunion; Saban planned to premiere the film on a cable network owned by the company before releasing it on video, and to follow the film with a television series if the film did well.\nAddams Family Reunion was scripted by Rob Kerchner, who had experience writing numerous direct-to-video sequels, and Scott Sandin; Saban wanted the script to be aimed only for children, with little attempt made to engage an adult audience. Dave Payne, whose directorial experience came from making direct-to-video low-budget horror films for Roger Corman, was hired to direct.\nAccording to Payne, Saban had purchased the rights from Charles Addams' estate, and he felt he could start fresh and create a dark fantasy film, comparing the approach he wanted to take as director to the Coen brothers. However, Payne says, Saban wanted him to imitate Barry Sonnenfeld's films and the 1964 TV show, and any original idea proposed by Payne and the screenwriters was rejected. In addition to the film lacking the previous entries' black comedy, Nathan Rabin also said that Addams Family Reunion has little of the anarchic satire of the Sonnenfeld films; according to Rabin, the only satirical aspect of the film is that the \"normal\" Adams family, whose reunion the Addamses mistakenly attend, \"turns out to be far more devious, conniving, and evil than the morbid but basically good Addams clan\".\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nThe producers wanted to bridge the gap in continuity between the Paramount films and the new series, and reached out to Anjelica Huston and Christopher Lloyd to reprise their roles as Morticia Addams and Uncle Fester, but both declined out of respect for Raul Julia. Christina Ricci and Jimmy Workman were too old to reprise their roles as Wednesday and Pugsley Addams. The only actors to reprise their roles from the Paramount films were Carel Struycken as Lurch, and Christopher Hart as Thing.\nRecast as Gomez and Morticia Addams were Tim Curry and Daryl Hannah, with Pat Thomas as Fester and Nicole Fugere as Wednesday, a role she would later reprise for The New Addams Family TV series, the only member of the film's cast to do so. According to Payne, he and Curry both felt that Gomez should be played \"weird\", in contrast to the Latin lothario Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1 had created for the Paramount duo of films. Much of the film's cast, including Alice Ghostley, Ray Walston, Clint Howard, and Ed Begley Jr., had appeared in numerous direct-to-video films.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nAddams Family Reunion was shot in Los Angeles, California on a 30-day schedule. Ed Begley Jr. arrived on set unprepared for his first day of filming as a tennis pro, explaining that he had no idea how to play tennis, resulting in the director shooting around Begley's inability to play the sport, and the actor was also difficult to costume, because, as a dedicated environmentalist, Begley would not wear any animal-based clothing such as leather.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe show's famous theme song was performed in a doo-wop rendition by the group Strate Vocalz, which Yahoo! described as being \"terrible\". According to Payne, he had developed a \"dark and edgy\" opening sequence with appropriate music by the film's composer, but Saban, without his knowledge, had replaced his original opening title sequence and the original music with \"some boy band, in bright fluorescent-colored shirts\".\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nAddams Family Reunion was released on September 22, 1998 straight-to-video.\nThe film was poorly received by critics, being compared unfavorably to the Paramount films, which reviewers felt Saban and Warner Bros. had tried, unsuccessfully, to imitate. Nathan Rabin wrote that \"the dialogue is awful, the acting sitcom-broad [...] [and] the direction [is] unremarkable\". Other points of criticism made in negative reviews included poor CGI and cheap-looking production design. However, Bloody Disgusting, Den of Geek and Nathan Rabin praised Tim Curry's performance as Gomez Addams.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAddams Family Reunion at IMDb",

            "Alice in Wonderland is a 1999 made-for-television film adaptation of Lewis Carroll's books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871). It was first broadcast on NBC and then shown on British television on Channel 4.\nTina Majorino played the lead role of Alice and a number of well-known performers portrayed the eccentric characters whom Alice meets during the course of the story, including Ben Kingsley, Martin Short, Whoopi Goldberg, Peter Ustinov, Christopher Lloyd, Gene Wilder, George Wendt, Robbie Coltrane and Miranda Richardson. In common with most adaptations of the book, it includes scenes and characters from Through the Looking-Glass.\nThe film won four Emmy Awards in the categories of costume design, makeup, music composition and visual effects.\nThe film was re-released as a special edition DVD on March 2, 2010, no special features were included, however the film was restored to its original speed as prior releases suffered from PAL speed up. A rare behind-the-scenes documentary of the film was released to YouTube in 2019, the 20th anniversary of the film's release.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAlice is unwillingly preparing a presentation of the song \"Cherry Ripe\" for a garden party. Nagged by her governess (Dilys Laye) and facing stage fright, an audience of strangers and a song she dislikes, Alice runs out of the house and hides in the woods. As clouds fill the sky, an apple falls from the tree and hovers in her face. She then sees the White Rabbit (voiced by Richard Coombs) and follows him down the rabbit hole, landing in Wonderland.\nIn an attempt to enter a small door and hide in a beautiful garden, Alice shrinks and grows into a giant, floods a room with tears and shrinks to the size of a mouse. She meets Mr Mouse (Ken Dodd) and his avian friends who attend his boring history lecture and participate in a Caucus Race. Alice again encounters the White Rabbit, who directs her to his house. Alice finds a bottle of liquid which makes her grow and traps her in the house. The White Rabbit and his gardeners Pat (Jason Byrne) and Bill (Paddy Joyce) attempt to remove Alice but she shrinks to a tiny size.\nWandering in long grass, she meets Major Caterpillar (Ben Kingsley), who tells her not to be afraid when performing. After he transforms into many butterflies, Alice returns to normal size by eating part of his mushroom. In a nearby manor house she meets the musical Duchess (Elizabeth Spriggs), her baby, her pepper-obsessed, plate-throwing cook (Sheila Hancock) and the Cheshire Cat (Whoopi Goldberg). The baby is left in Alice's care but turns into a pig and she lets him go. The Cheshire Cat advises Alice to visit the Mad Hatter and his friend the March Hare.\nMeeting the two and their Dormouse friend at a tea party, Alice is given advice on the fun of performing and how to get around stage fright. The Mad Hatter (Martin Short) leaps onto the table to perform as he previously had at a concert of the wicked Queen of Hearts. Alice leaves when the Mad Hatter and March Hare start to cause havoc and stuff the Dormouse in a teapot.\nAlice once again finds the small door and this time manages to enter the garden, which unfortunately turns out to be a labyrinth maze belonging to the Queen of Hearts (Miranda Richardson). The Queen invites her to a bizarre game of croquet, but her love for beheading people annoys Alice. The Cheshire Cat's face appears in the air and is ordered to be executed, but Alice's logic stays the order and everyone applauds her. Alice escapes the croquet game and meets the Gryphon (voiced by Donald Sinden) and Mock Turtle (Gene Wilder). The two sing with Alice, encouraging her and teaching her the Lobster Quadrille dance. Alice then wanders away and opens a colossal book and walks into an illustration of the woods, making her in the woods. She meets the White Knight (Christopher Lloyd) who fights against a Red Knight, who encourages her to be brave when she goes home.\nAlice meets some talking flowers: a Tiger-Lily (voiced by Joanna Lumley), the most sensible of all, some roses, who are rude and not too bothered about Alice being lost, and some daisies, who are rascals. Having the flowers help her, Alice walks off and meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Robbie Coltrane and George Wendt), who have some antics with her such as telling the story of The Walrus and the Carpenter before getting into a fight. Alice is then chased by clouds and taken by a pair of card soldiers to the royal court, where the Knave of Hearts (Jason Flemyng) is put on trial for apparently stealing the Queen's tarts. Alice is then called to the stand, but she uses some mushroom to grow to great heights. Upon seeing the tarts have been untouched and the trial is pointless, she openly criticises the Queen and King Cedric. The White Rabbit, who is present at the court, reveals he lured Alice into Wonderland to conquer her fears and asks her if she has self-confidence. Upon Alice answering yes, he states, \"then you don't need us anymore.\" She is then sent back home by the same hovering apple and clouds that brought her there.\nAwakening back home seconds after the apple fell, Alice courageously sings in front of her parents and their guests (who all resemble the Wonderland characters), but instead of singing \"Cherry Ripe\", she sings the Lobster Quadrille. The audience, to Alice's delight, all enjoy her performance. Alice spots her cat Dinah in the audience, who is really the Cheshire Cat who grins at her in congratulations.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTina Majorino as Alice \u2013 A curious young girl who is nervous and unenthusiastic about performing the song Cherry Ripe at her parents' party in the beginning.

He informs Alice that he once sang the same piece during the Queen's concert but was sent away because she was offended by his performance. The Mad Hatter was also called as a witness to the Knave's trial, where he reprised his performance, further angering the queen and causing her to chase him away as she shouted \"off with his head!\" Presumably, he and the March Hare escaped decapitation again due to their speed.\nWhoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat \u2013 A grinning cat who teaches Alice \"the rules\" of Wonderland.

This film is based on the McKenna books in the American Girl series written by Mary Casanova. The film is also the second in the series to feature a Girl of the Year character, the first being Chrissa Stands Strong, and is the sixth film in the American Girl series overall.\nThe film is about the life of McKenna Brooks, as she struggles to balance her time at school and in her career as a gymnast. The screenplay was written by Jessica O'Toole and Amy Rardin. The movie was directed by Vince Marcello.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFourth grader McKenna Brooks competes for Shooting Star gymnastics alongside her best friend Toulane Thomas. They both dream of competing in the 2016 Olympics. For now, their immediate goal is to make the regional competitive team. McKenna practices back handspring dismounts for her balance beam routine. However, her coach Isabelle Manning tells her that the move is too advanced for her and she should stick to the easier dismount for now. McKenna and Toulane discuss the new girl Sierra and a girl from another team who is guaranteed to get one of the three spots on the team.\nAfter practice, McKenna learns from her parents that her grades are slipping and Mr. Wu, her teacher, recommends she get a middle school reading tutor. McKenna's parents believe that she's spending too much time on gymnastics and not enough on school. McKenna refuses a tutor and promises to bring her grades up as there's going to be a science quiz the next day. She starts to read the science book, but doesn't understand it and quits.\nThe next day at school, McKenna struggles during the quiz and ends up cheating off of Sierra's paper. She gets caught by Mr. Wu. and is given a zero. McKenna's parents then give her an ultimatum to either meet with a tutor or quit gymnastics. The next day, McKenna meets her tutor Josie Myers, who uses a wheelchair, at the school's library. McKenna hides from Sierra to avoid embarrassment. After showing little progress in reading comprehension, McKenna is angry when Josie tries to make her read \"baby books\". She asks Mr. Wu to find her a new tutor. McKenna tries three different tutors who won't work for her, and Mr. Wu makes her go back to Josie.\nAt a presentation run, the Shooting Stars gymnastics team perform for the parents. McKenna performs her beam routine and disobeys her coach by doing the back handsprings, but falls and breaks her ankle. McKenna is ruled out for eight weeks but starts exercises that don't involve her broken foot in two weeks. Her parents suggest this gives her an opportunity to focus on her schoolwork, but McKenna gets upset and fears giving up her dream to make the team.\nThe next time McKenna meets with Josie, she spends their session trying to hide from Sierra again but is caught and ends up setting off the fire alarm, much to Josie's disappointment. However, Sierra reveals she had a tutor once too and promises to keep McKenna's secret. Feeling assured, McKenna apologizes to Josie and takes the tutoring seriously. They start to develop a friendship and McKenna encourages Josie to find a way to ride a horse that will accommodate her disability. McKenna's mother also assures her that it's okay needing help with finding balance. One day, a suspicious Toulane spies on McKenna and discovers the tutoring sessions. She's hurt that McKenna lied to her for so long. The Brooks invite the Myers on their annual camping trip while Toulane refuses to come. While sharing a tent, McKenna reveals to Josie Toulane's struggles with living up to her mother's expectations.\nMcKenna is excited when she's able to understand A Little Princess while reading it. Josie admits McKenna inspired her and she found a program that allows kids with disabilities to ride horses. Josie invites McKenna to go but she refuses, remembering she gets her cast off the same day. They have an argument and Josie leaves, hurt. However, McKenna changes her mind and decides to support Josie. There, she runs into Toulane, who Josie invited too. They make up when McKenna apologizes and assures Toulane she still cares about gymnastics. Later, Mr. Wu. assigns his class a book report towards the end of the year that involves a presentation the day after the qualifying meet. McKenna begins to feel a lot of pressure. With the qualifying meet three weeks away, she is cleared but becomes nervous and struggles with her dismount (the skill she was injured on). McKenna decides to do her presentation on a book about athletes and becomes intrigued learning about them.\nAt the regional competitive team's qualifying meet, McKenna finds a worn out Toulane in the bathrooms. She admits to McKenna that she's sick of competitive gymnastics ever since her mother pushed her into it so that Toulane can follow in the footsteps of her older sister, a star gymnast. Toulane reveals she has been watching the rhythmic gymnastics practices and wishes she could do that instead, as she used to be a dancer. McKenna convinces Toulane to talk with her mother after the meet. They successfully perform their routines and Toulane even supports Sierra. At the end of her beam routine, McKenna hesitates on the dismount, but after seeing Josie in the audience, she goes for it and sticks the landing.\nMcKenna and Toulane are among the top finishers for the regional competitive team, but Toulane finally confronts her mother and is allowed to switch to rhythmic gymnastics. She gives her place on the competitive team to a much-improved Sierra, who was named first alternate.

Saige's best friend Tessa Joblansky, a musician, befriended another girl named Dylan Patterson at summer camp and hangs out with her instead, making Saige jealous. A new girl in school named Gabi Pe\u00f1a, who is also an artist, becomes friends with Saige. Saige tells her grandmother, whom she calls Mimi, about the situation, and Mimi proposes a school-wide protest against the art class removal. Saige also works to reconnect with Tessa.\nLater, Mimi trips over Saige's dog, Rembrandt, and is hospitalized for a broken leg and wrist. At the hospital, she encourages Saige to continue on with her protest. At school, Saige tells Tessa, Gabi and Dylan (who was invited by Tessa) her protest plan, \"A Day of Beige\", inspired by her visit to the hospital. Dylan suggests a press conference in order to gain more attention since her mother works as a news reporter, to which Saige reluctantly agrees. The demonstrations are held as planned with all of the students wearing beige, but is nearly put to a halt as Saige and her friends are summoned to the principal's office. After an explanation, Principal Laird gives the girls the permission to hold the press conference. Upon being interviewed, Saige is overwhelmed with stage fright and leaves, so Dylan answers the reporters' questions in her place.\nPrincipal Laird later informs the girls that there aren't anymore funds to hire an art teacher, and they would need to earn $5,000 in six weeks for the art class to start this year. Mimi suggests a fund drive to be held at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, and to have her granddaughter lead the annual parade in her place as she may not make it in time for the event. Saige worries about her stage fright despite her family and trainer Luis' assurances. The four girls take up various odd jobs to earn funds, but are largely unsuccessful. Dylan suggests a concert at the fiesta and they can split between art and music, which Saige has doubts about.\nLater at the ranch, Saige and her horse Picasso do a practice run for the parade, but she struggles to concentrate. Meanwhile, Saige and Gabi are worried that Dylan and Tessa's part for the fundraiser is getting more attention than theirs. Saige and Picasso do another run at the ranch, this time with success as they manage to pull off a gait without being distracted. At Mimi's ranch, Saige and Gabi bond. After Rembrandt knocks over Saige's painting, she gets an idea.\nAt school, Saige and Gabi propose combining their efforts in the fundraiser. Dylan and Tessa argue that they have their plans already set, but Saige disagrees, leading to a confrontation. Saige claims that the Tessa she knows would agree with her before flying into a rage against Dylan, accusing her of stealing the spotlight over her efforts, for which she is rejected by Tessa.\nSaige tries to talk Mimi into doing artwork or coming to the parade, but Mimi doesn't think she can. Saige gets upset and confesses that the arrangements are worse than she has been admitting, but also that the Mimi she knows wouldn't give up, before running off. Another practice run with Picasso takes place, but when her parents and Gabi show up, Saige is too frustrated to continue. She worries that the fiesta is going to be a disaster and she doesn't have anymore fundraising ideas. Gabi leaves when Saige blurts out that she wants things to be the same as the year before.\nDuring a hot air balloon ride, Saige's father advises her about accepting change. She later reconciles with Gabi, and apologizes to Mimi. After her horse practice, Saige goes to Mimi's studio and decides to paint over her horse painting with a painting knife, turning it into an abstract work. Tessa arrives, and both girls admit to their mistakes and reconcile, agreeing to work together for the fiesta. Saige gets an idea to use Mimi's unfinished mural for the concert. She also makes amends with Dylan, with the latter apologizing over how she was taking over Saige's fundraiser.\nWith the Balloon Fiesta taking place, Saige leads the parade in front of onlookers. She is nervous at first, but eventually overcomes her fears. The girls later put on a joint fund-raising art exhibit and concert as previously planned. The show is a success, but the school is short of the $5,000 goal. Saige then makes a speech in front of the audience about how important art is to her and to others, which pushes for some extra money to be put into the fundraiser from them. The donation goal is reached, with the art program being reinstated.\nBack at the hot air balloon show, Saige, Tessa, Gabi, and Dylan (now all best friends) ride a hot air balloon Saige designed as the film ends.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSidney Fullmer as Saige Copeland, a 9-year-old girl who has a passion for art.

Yet when a gang of bully birds threatens his ringmaster father and takes over the circus, Cuco sets off on a hilarious and full of Mexican ads journey to Hollywood to enlist his hero in his fight, only to discover the true hero within himself.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nEnglish cast\nRico Rodriguez as Cuco\nKate del Castillo as Rayito*\nCheech Marin as Martin\nGabriel Iglesias as Garza Garc\u00eda\nLisa Kudrow as Lucille Van Starr*\nEdward James Olmos as Gayo \"El Jefe\"*\nGrecia Villar as Paquito*\nPaul Rodriguez as Divino*\nArgelia Atilano as Lori*\nRicardo Sanchez as Vovo*\nK.

The idea of the film's plot was brought up when he visited the United States and met producer Gerry Cardoso, who brought up the idea of birds, traveling from Spain to Mexico. Arnaiz insisted to change the setting to the United States. \u201cI said it would be great to make them go from Mexico to the United States, so we started from that,\u201d said Arnaiz. \u201cWe were very careful to be respectful of both countries. We wanted to tell a story about how borders are just a line on a map and when you are honest and you do things the right way there are a lot of possibilities out there for everybody.\u201d Bringing the project to the United States was one of the biggest challenges in the film's development.\n\nHe later met actor Edward James Olmos, when he found that Olmos was \"a hit\" and a fan of La leyenda de la Nahuala. After reading the script, Olmos agreed to join the film's production team and voice cast. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to be working with Edward James Olmos and his production company here in the US. It's a story we have been working on for the last three years and we feel we have a really strong team in place to execute this film scheduled in 2013.\u201d\n\nOn 26 September 2013, the film was presented at Ibero Puebla, revealing new screenshots and clips. During production, Edward James Olmos had recorded his voice before the animation process. Many cast members were required to act out their roles before recording their voices. According to director Ricardo Arnaiz, it is the most expensive film from Animex Producciones and the first to exceed over $29 million pesos.\n\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe visual effects and animation production were done by Boxel Studio in Tijuana. Additional animation and crowding was handled by Cutting Edge Productions in Philippines. In an interview with Andres Reyes Botello, founder of Boxel Studios, Ricardo Arnaiz initially stated he originally intended to produce the film in traditional animation, but Edward James Olmos insisted Arnaiz use CG animation as the best chance of the film's success. \"Back then, he was explaining to me his situation with his 2D animation studio and his curiosity about making El Americano into a full 3D CGI production\", said Andres Reyes Botello. \"From there, we instantly got on to a good relationship and started working on the development for the characters and environments, doing some animation, lighting, and rendering tests for this film.\" Arnaiz did not have much experience in CG animation. As a director of Nikte, he finds the transition from traditional animation to computer animation \"complicated\" since its vision in the field of animation was \"cartoonish\". This was not changed with El Americano; however, Arnaiz wanted to capture some scenes in traditional animation.\nLater, after being impressed by Boxel Studios' works, Arnaiz has decided to partner with the studio, which primarily focuses on animation for video games and advertising. \u201cThey were very creative, they had a lot of knowledge and I said: \u2018Would you be interested in doing a movie with me? I don\u2019t know anything about CGI, you don\u2019t know anything about making movies \u2014 let\u2019s combine and create this thing together,\u201d says Arnaiz. For assistance, Arnaiz tapped animation veteran Raul Garcia, and Mike Kunkel, who is Arnaiz's personal friend and longed-hoped to work with him, and brought them to Boxel Studios. \u201cThey taught everyone how to make animation, Hollywood style, and in Mexico, we taught the Americans how to do it with low budgets,\u201d said Arnaiz. A total of 25 animators have worked on this film. Arnaiz has stated that the development of the film was challenging. However, the film was finished on time and on budget. \u201cThe biggest challenge was to get it to the level that everyone was hoping for us,\u201d said Arnaiz. \u201cThey thought at first that we were going to go to like a direct-to-video quality at the most, and once we showed them some clips they were really excited about it.\u201d Development for the film finished in August 2013.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe film features a distinctive ensemble voice cast, primarily consisting of famous Mexican and Hispanic American actors. Director Ricardo Arnaiz was satisfied with the casting, which was one of the biggest challenges of the film. \"It was the cast [in] which I [have] dreamed [of] since the beginning of the project,\" said Arnaiz. \"Both my producers in Mexico and the United States moved to get this great talent. They quickly fell in love [with the] story, characters, theme potential, and ambition brand internationally.\"\nOn 17 April 2013, actress Lisa Kudrow has joined the voice cast as Lucille in both English and Spanish versions. She is the only non-Hispanic cast member.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe film's original score was composed by Leoncio Lara, whom he previously worked for animated films produced by \u00c1nima Estudios.\nThe soundtrack features 12 original songs written and composed by various Latin artists, and three score pieces composed by Leoncio Lara Bon. The album features the song \"Hasta el Cielo Alcanzar\" (film's main song) written and performed by six-time Latin GRAMMY nominated Aleks Syntek. The album also contains songs by La Arrolladora Banda Lim\u00f3n, Los Tucanes de Tijuana, 3Ball Mty. featuring Don Cheto, Amanditita, Duelo, Horacio Palencia and many more. The Soundtrack is produced by Gerry Cardoso, Ricardo Arnaiz and Tomas Rubio.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\n\n=== Premiere and theatrical ===\nThe film premiered at the Morelia International Film Festival on 22 October 2013. The film had its U.S. screening at The Strong National Museum of Play theater in Rochester, New York on 15 March 2014. It was shown in both Spanish and English. The film was presented at San Diego Comic-Con on 25 July 2014. The title of the conference is \"Big Ideas for Movies: Crossing the Borders with Mexican Animation\".\nIt had an advanced screening at the 22nd Annual San Diego Film Festival on 14 March 2015. The film had its world carpet premiere on 14 May 2015 at the Regal Cinemas L.A. Live Stadium 14 theater in Los Angeles, California.\nAs of 2016, the film had been distributed in many countries throughout Central and South America, Europe, and Asia. Most importantly, this is the first film to be supported by Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf\u00eda (IMCINE) that originated from the state of Puebla. \"A project is supported by Fidecine and EFICINE when they see it consolidated, and with high expectations,\" said Arnaiz. \"Films like Don Gato (Top Cat) or Una Pel\u00edcula de Huevos have a great role in the box office and we also hope that this film [El Americano] can open doors for more animation support in Mexico.\" However, the film only received a limited release, opening only in 160 theaters nationwide. This was due to being distributed by an independent company, Never Landing Data Distribution, despite the film's immersive cast, budget, and its notable first U.S.\u2013Mexico co-production status. \"They wanted Edward [James Olmos] and choose Neverlanding Pictures S.A.P.I., Alejandro Sugich, a Mexican distributor of content and we released 160 copies, but we hope to do well to be in more rooms,\" Arnaiz said.\nThe film has faced numerous delays before its release; the film was originally intended for release September 2013 release, then a Summer 2014 release, and then a Summer 2015 release. In Mexico, the film was released on January 22, 2016 in Digital 3D and 2D theaters.\nOriginally planned for a theatrical release to open at about 1,200 theaters across the United States distributed by Freestyle Releasing, the film was instead later released straight-to-video and on VOD on June 13, 2017 by Grindstone Entertainment and Lionsgate Home Entertainment.\n\n\n=== Immigration impact ===\nThe film focuses on immigration, in which protagonist Cuco and his friends travel to the Mexico\u2013United States border. Edward James Olmos, the film's executive producer and voice of Gayo, found this film a perfect opportunity for thousands of Mexican children for them to know their roots. \"There are successful films that are very strong, but it goes straight to the hearts of children,\" said Olmos during a press conference in Mexico City, promoting the film. \"The policy of this film is beautiful! Ricardo Arnaiz is homered as ever! As Erik Estrada's character [said] in the film: 'You could fly nonstop, but they came here [to America]. What fun!'\" Olmos also hoped that this film could revisit the ongoing illegal immigration epidemic in the United States, and reform then-President Barack Obama to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants in the country.\n\n\n=== Rating in Mexico controversy ===\nUpon its theatrical release in Mexico, the Direcci\u00f3n General de Radio, Televisi\u00f3n y Cinematograf\u00eda (RTC) has given the film a B rating due to the film's violence and \"occasional\" sexuality, which required ages 12 years or older (similar to the MPAA's PG-13 rating), sparking controversy upon families and the filmmakers. \"The narrative can be complex; it presents some degree of violence, not extreme, for specific reasons and not related to sexuality, making clear [for] its consequences,\" said RTC. \"The nudes are brief and not [just] detailed and suggested sex scenes. You can address the issue of addiction and drugs, but without exhibiting their consumption. Verbal violence can not be extreme.\" Reports asked director Ricardo Arnaiz about the film's rating issue, but didn't initially respond. On his Twitter, he has posted \"Unfortunately, some people won't believe or want [to see] the film.\" The film's B rating have concerned parents whether or not they find the film appropriate for their children to see, which it could be said to contribute to the film's box-office under-performance. Executive producer Edward James Olmos responded to the film's issue, saying that \"El Americano is a film that children are going crazy to go see something wonderful that will represent Mexico and the world, showing the work, values and cultures of Mexicans with a family history.\" After receiving complaints from social media, the RTC checked its database and finally confirmed the rating as an \"error\". The RTC has changed the film's rating from B to AA, which allows the attendance of children ages 7 years and older.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAlthough the film was projected to open at #2 place at the Mexican box office. the film however, as an independently released film, it is considered a moderate box-office success, releasing in only 129 locations, and topping other independent releases, such as Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet and Plastic.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 40%  approval rating based on 5 reviews, with an average score of 2/10.\n\n\n== Future ==\nDirector Ricardo Arnaiz has expressed plans for a sequel, with the support of executive producer Edward James Olmos. However, they want the proceeding film to be successful and reach 200 copies by the film's second week in theaters. There has not been any further information regarding a planned sequel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial Website (in English)\nOfficial Website (in Spanish)\nEl Americano: The Movie at IMDb\nEl Americano: The Movie at Rotten Tomatoes",
            "Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure is a 1988 science fiction children's film directed by Deborah Brock and written by Brock and Jed Horovitz. It stars Randy Josselyn, Dianne Kay, Chuck Kovacic, John Franklin, and Vince Edwards. Its plot is about a boy who has to travel through several videos and static-filled channels in order to rescue his sister, who was snatched into the television because she sat too close to it.\nAs it was thought the film's original release title would be confused with Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, the name was changed to Andy and the Airwave Rangers for 1989 video release.  The film is referred to as a full-length \"cheater\" in that it takes advantage of film highlights gleaned from previous Roger Corman films Space Raiders, Wizards of the Lost Kingdom, Deathsport, Chopping Mall, and Wheels of Fire.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAndy Colby (Randy Josselyn) is a 12-year-old boy with too much time on his hands and an addiction to movies. He goes to a local video store looking for a movie he hasn't seen and asks the crazy video store clerk (John Bluto), for a real adventure.  He is given a new video that isn't even on the shelves yet. He is also given instructions to never let go of the remote and don't sit too close to the television.\nUnfortunately, his sister Bonnie (Jessica Puscas) is instead sucked into the TV and Andy has to rescue her. In his haste he ends up letting go of the remote and gets too close to the screen. With the help of  characters from past movies, Andy has to face many trials to get his sister away from the purple and barely menacing villain, Lord Chroma (Chuck Kovacic).\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRandy Josselyn as Andy Colby\nDianne Kay as Mrs. Colby\nJohn Bluto as Video Store Clerk\nChuck Kovacic as Lord Chroma\nDon Sparks as The Glitch\nJohn Franklin as The Gatekeeper\nLara Piper as Bionda\nJessica Puscas as Bonnie Colby\nVince Edwards as Space Raider\nPatsy Pease as Space Raider\nLuca Bercovici as Space Raider\nDrew Snyder as Space Raider\nThom Christopher as Space Raider\nDon Washburn as Space Raider\nBo Svenson as Kor The Conqueror\nErik Estrada\nRichard Thomas\n\n\n== Release ==\nAfter its limited 1988 theatrical release as Andy Colby\u2019s Incredibly Awesome Adventure, the film was released in 1989 as Andy and the Airwave Rangers. Over its various video releases the film was sometimes titled Andy Colby's Incredible Video Adventure.  This film had little impact on the market of the late 80s. It is a \u2018B\u2019 film and was considered so in its various straight to VHS releases. Though released in VHS in 1989 and DVD in 2006, the film can still be found theatrically at locations showing older films, such as The Cinefamily Silent Movie Theater in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nAllrovi wrote that with the film's \"crazy-quilt melange\", its \"young stars perform as well as possible under the circumstances (it's hard to be convincing while reacting to stock footage), but the film's acting honors go to Chuck Kovacic as the wigged-out villain.\"  The film had DVD release on February 7, 2006 by Walt Disney Video.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAndy Colby's Incredible Adventure at the Internet Movie Database",

            "Beauty and the Beast: Belle's Magical World is a 1998 direct-to-video animated anthology musical film, made of unused TV episodes produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It was released on February 17, 1998, and it is the sequel to Disney's 1991 animated feature film Beauty and the Beast and the third in the Beauty and the Beast films, featuring the voices of David Ogden Stiers as Cogsworth, Robby Benson as The Beast, Gregory Grudt, who replaced Bradley Pierce as Chip Potts, Paige O'Hara as Belle, Anne Rogers, who replaced Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Potts, and Jerry Orbach as Lumiere. The film features two songs performed by Belle, \"Listen With Our Hearts\" and \"A Little Thought.\" This storyline is set within the timeline of the original Beauty and the Beast (after the fight against the wolves but before the fight against Gaston  and Christmas).\nWhen first released in 1998, the film consisted of three connected segments, which are \"The Perfect Word\", \"Fifi's Folly\" and \"The Broken Wing\". For the special edition released in 2003, another segment was included, \"Mrs. Potts' Party\" (from Belle's Tales of Friendship) making the film 22 minutes longer.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film consists of three episodes of an unreleased television series, loosely woven together in a feature-length story and also based on the original Disney animated feature. It was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and animated by Toon City Animation, Inc. in Manila, Philippines and Thai Wang Film Productions in Bangkok, Thailand. Finished and copyrighted in the fall of 1997, at the time when Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas was released, the film was originally set for release on January 13, 1998, but was pushed to February 17th for unknown reasons.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== The Perfect Word ===\nThe Beast (Robby Benson) and Belle (Paige O'Hara) plan to eat together, and the Beast asks for advice from Lumiere (Jerry Orbach). While Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers) escorts Belle to the dining room, they come across the castle's well-meaning but rather verbose scribe, Webster (Jim Cummings), turned into a dictionary, whom Belle invites to join them in the dining room (to Cogsworth's dismay).\nDuring the meal, while Belle explains a story she has been reading to the Beast, the Beast gets sweaty. He demands for the windows to be opened, despite there being a draft of air in the room and the servants getting cold. The Beast and Belle get into an argument, and the Beast strikes Webster off the table when the dictionary begins giving unwanted synonyms to Belle's insults. Subsequently, they both stop speaking to each other, despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's attempts to patch things up. Eventually, Webster, feeling guilty for his part, forges a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle with his friends, a pile of papers named Crane (Jeff Bennett) and a quill named LePlume (Rob Paulsen). Belle sees the letter, and makes amends with the Beast.\nThat night, however, the truth comes out, and after a furious chase around the castle, the Beast catches and banishes Webster with brokenhearted Crane and LePlume for the forgery, throwing them into the forest. Belle ventures out and brings them back, and the Beast, touched by Belle's sympathy, forgives the three and allows them back in, realizing that their intentions were good. The moral of the story is that it is easy to forgive, and the song \"Listen With Our Hearts\" plays.\n\n\n=== Fifi's Folly ===\nOn Valentine's Day, Lumiere grows nervous to the point that he cleans himself excessively and turns to Belle for advice, by walking with her in the garden and reciting what he plans to say to Fifi (Kimmy Robertson) to her. Fifi overhears this, and believes that Lumiere and Belle are having an affair behind her back. In reality, Lumiere has planned a surprise snow ride around the castle gardens with Fifi. To get back at Lumiere, Fifi attempts to make Cogsworth like her, who is apparently not interested.\nIn the end, things are cleared up and Lumiere and Fifi go for the ride, but the pot they are sitting in slips off the edge of the balcony and hangs over the moat. Lumiere holds onto Fifi while hanging for dear life, and tells her that he loves her. Before they can fall, Belle, Cogsworth and a few more servants arrive and get them back to safety. Everyone ends up learning to not jump to conclusions, and Lumiere and Fifi kiss.\n\n\n=== Mrs. Potts' Party ===\nMrs. Potts is feeling depressed due to dreadful weather, and Belle decides to cheer her up by throwing a surprise party for her. Belle has come to look at Mrs. Potts as a mother figure by this point. During preparations for the party, Belle and her friends have to avoid waking up the sleeping Beast. The Beast spent the entire previous night fixing a leak in the roof and needs his sleep. However, Lumiere and Cogsworth's rivalry gets in the way. The two argue and compete over the tasks of composing music, choosing Mrs. Potts' favorite flowers, and choosing the flavors of the cake that will be served at the party. Two oven mits, Chaude (the red mit) and Tres (the blue mit), also take part in the argument, as they each side with one of the rivals.\nEventually, Lumiere and Cogsworth's attempt to sabotage one another's decisions has consequences. The baking cake explodes and makes a complete mess in the kitchen. Lumiere and Cogsworth, after a scolding from Belle, decide to put their rivalry behind them for good and work together to make a small surprise for Mrs. Potts. The plan goes well, Mrs. Potts is cured of her depression, and the sun finally shines again. Everyone learns the power of cooperation and compromises, accompanied by the song \"A Little Thought\".\n\n\n=== The Broken Wing ===\nBelle and the Beast arrange to have lunch together again, but an injured bird accidentally flies into Belle's room, and she forgets her arrangement, instead paying more attention to the bird. The Beast discovers this, and flies into a rage, as he has a strong dislike for birds, trying to catch the bird, but he trips over Cogsworth and hits his head hard on the floor. This strips him of his hatred for birds, but his selfishness remains, driving him to lock the bird in a cage and demand that he sing for him when he pleases, but the obviously saddened and frightened bird refuses.\nMeanwhile, Cogsworth feels he is losing control over his staff, and demands their respect with harsh treatment. In the meantime, Belle convinces the Beast to release the bird once its wing is cured. But the bird, still too weak, begins to fall, and the Beast rushes to rescue it. In the process, Cogsworth falls from the West Wing balcony and into the garden. He is unhurt, and learns that you cannot demand respect, but you can earn it by giving it. Belle and the Beast make amends, and the Beast learns to treat people and animals with respect, compassion and attention.\n\n\n== Voice cast ==\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers - Cogsworth, Narrator\nRobby Benson - The Beast\nGregory Grudt - Chip\nPaige O'Hara - Belle\nAnne Rogers - Mrs. Potts\nJerry Orbach - Lumiere\nKimmy Robertson - Fifi the Featherduster\nFrank Welker - Sultan the Footstool\nJim Cummings - Webster, Tubaloo, Chef Bouche, Punch Bowl\nJeff Bennett - Crane, Frappe\nRob Paulsen - LePlume, Tres, Egg Beater\nApril Winchell - Chandeleria, Chaude, Concertina\nJo Anne Worley - Armoire the Wardrobe\n\n\n== Home media ==\nBelle's Magical World was released on VHS in the United States and Canada on February 17, 1998; the film consisted of three connected segments called The Perfect World, Fifi's Folly and The Broken Wing.

It was the first of the titles in the Muppet Sing-Alongs series filmed in 1990 before production on The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson and released on May 21, 1993. This film was credited as one of Carmen Osbahr's first projects with the Muppets, and also served as one of Richard Hunt's final works, as he died in 1992.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nKermit the Frog welcomes the viewer to the Muppet Sing-Along Video and allows us to hear a story about a bunny who travels outside his home to learn new songs from his animal friends and to sing-along to them.\nThe story begins when Billy Bunny is at his family home, singing \"Hoppity-Boppity\", which is the only song he knows, much to the annoyance of his family. Billy's mommy asks him to go outside to learn new songs. Billy first stops by at a gopher village, where he discovers that every gopher looks the same, despite them having different personalities (\"We Are Different\"). Next, he meets three polite bears - Cecil, Edgar, and Percival - who sing a rap about their personalities and why they roar (\"Bear Rap\").\nNext, Billy meets a termite, who sings about his joys of eating wood (\"The Termite Chew\"). As Billy enters a deep forest, he meets two raccoons. When he asks them what they're doing here in the woods, they explain that it's a secret and they sing about it (\"I Have a Secret\").\nNext, Billy accidentally bumps into a porcupine. He appears to be fine, but the porcupine invites him to her nightclub and sings \"Please Don't Bump Into Me\", about less harmful things to bump into, such as a beagle and a kangaroo. Midway, during the instrumental break, a penguin waiter asks Billy what he'd say to a little carrot juice (Billy: \"Well, I\u2019d say \u2019hello, little carrot juice\u2019.\") When the porcupine's song is over, she asks Billy if she'd like to stay for the second show. Billy leaves, right before the penguin arrives with a glass of carrot juice.\nNext, Billy goes over to a pond, where he meets some frogs, who sing about their \"Frog Talk\". Finally, Billy meets a turtle and asks if he knows any songs. The turtle says he doesn't know much... except that he likes to observe what's going on around the bay and then does a \"teeter-totter\" on a rock and swims away. The turtle sums it up into a song - \"Swim Away, Hooray!\" - and Billy joins in with him. It's now late and Billy has to go home.\nWhen Billy comes home just in time for dinner, he explains to his family that he knows eight songs, and the one song that's his favorite is \"Hoppity-Boppity\". Billy's family joins in with him and Kermit thanks the viewers for singing along with Billy. All the animals reprise \"Hoppity-Boppity\" together, ending the video.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Muppet performers ===\nKevin Clash - Billy Bunny\nFran Brill - Frog, Porcupine\nRichard Hunt - Edgar Bear, Raccoon\nRick Lyon -\nJim Martin - Frog, Gopher\nJoey Mazzarino - Frog\nKathryn Mullen - Mother Bunny, Frog, Gopher\nJerry Nelson - Cecil Bear, Frog, Raccoon, Turtle\nCarmen Osbahr - Gopher\nDavid Rudman - Frog, Gopher, Penguin, Percival Bear, Termite\nSteve Whitmire - Kermit the Frog\n\n\n== Other appearances ==\nBilly Bunny appeared in Muppet Sing Alongs It's Not Easy Being Green and a Muppet Time sketch where he tries to join the Frog Scouts.\nThe puppet for the Porcupine appeared in The Muppet Christmas Carol.\nThe puppet for the Termite appeared in No, You Shut Up!\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBilly Bunny's Animal Songs at Muppet Wiki",
            "Bingo is a 1991 American family comedy film directed by Matthew Robbins from a script by Jim Strain. The film follows Bingo, a clever runaway circus dog who goes on a cross-country search to find Chuckie (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.), a boy he befriended. Along the way, Bingo gets into various adventures with colorful characters. Bingo was portrayed by Lace, a female border collie adopted from a shelter. Principal photography began on September 12, 1990.\nThe film was released to theaters on August 9, 1991 by TriStar Pictures. It was a box office disappointment and received mostly negative reviews. The film is intended as a parody of boy-and-his-dog films and has elements of absurdist humor and dark comedy.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the outskirts of Denver, Colorado, Bingo the Border Collie performs routine chores for a circus. When one of the star poodles injures its foot, Bingo is asked to stand in for that night\u2019s performance. However, Bingo\u2019s fear of fire leads him to chicken out of jumping through a hoop of fire. Bingo\u2019s fear stems from having lost his mother to a fire as a puppy. Bingo, berated by the circus master for his failure, leaves in search of a better life. \n12-year-old Chuckie Devlin is attempting to show off his bike skills to friends by jumping it across a river. Instead, he falls into the river and wrecks his bike. Bingo sees the unconscious boy and rescues him. The dog and the boy quickly bond, and Chuckie takes him home where he lives with his older brother Chickie, mother Natalie, and father Hal, a placekicker for the Denver Broncos. Chuckie hides Bingo away in a cabinet as his family does not want a pet.\nBingo is eventually found out when Chuckie goes to school and the family finds evidence of the dog\u2019s mischief. They angrily confront the boy when he comes home, but this becomes forgotten when Hal suddenly learns he has been traded to the Green Bay Packers. The next day, the family departs for Wisconsin, leaving Bingo behind. However, Chuckie comes up with a plan to be reunited with Bingo: leaving a scent trail for Bingo to follow by urinating at road stops. \nBingo follows along the \"trail\" and gets roped into multiple misadventures\u2014including banding together with other dogs to destroy a hot dog stand that uses the meat of impounded mutts, and helping to catch Lennie and Eli, two criminals who have hijacked a camper and taken a family as hostages. When he is falsely accused of a crime he did not commit, Bingo is sent to jail, but later escapes.\nBingo finally makes it to Green Bay, but sees Chuckie walking another dog. Bingo, not realizing that it is a neighbor\u2019s dog, wanders off, dejected at having been replaced. He eventually gets a job licking the plates clean at a nearby diner. Lennie and Eli escape prison and track down the dog to Green Bay. They post reward flyers for Bingo, and one of the diner employees responds, alerting them to the dog's whereabouts. Chuckie happens to see a flyer too, and the boy, the dog, and the two criminals converge in an alley behind the diner. When Lennie and Eli discover Chuckie is the son of a professional football player, they hold the boy captive in a warehouse. Knowing they can successfully gamble on a rigged outcome, they call Chuckie\u2019s mother and say they will only give up the boy if Hal misses all his field goals during the day\u2019s game. \nBingo is able to get away and warn Natalie and Chickie, before returning to rescue Chuckie. The dog is overpowered by Lennie and Eli, who tie him up next to Chuckie and reveal a bomb with which they intend to destroy the warehouse. As the goons leave, they toss a cigar, leading to the warehouse catching fire. Bingo breaks free of his restraints, but his fear prevents him from leaping through to get to the fire alarm. When Chuckie begins to collapse from heat and smoke inhalation, Bingo overcomes his fear and triggers the alarm. Firemen arrive and rescue Chuckie while police surround Lennie and Eli\u2019s car. The criminals threaten to trigger the bomb unless Hal misses the game-deciding field goal, but the police call the criminals\u2019 bluff. \nBack at the warehouse, Bingo carries the bomb away from the site. Hal makes the field goal, and Chuckie watches, horrified, as the bomb explodes in the distance. Later, the boy awakens in a hospital, and his family takes him to a room down the hall where Bingo is recuperating. The room is filled with all the people and dogs that Bingo has encountered along his journey. Chuckie and Bingo celebrate their reunion, and the former asks his dad if he can keep the dog. After some encouragement, Hal gives in and says, \"Sure, son. Just as soon as we have him neutered\", prompting a nervous look from Bingo.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Merchandise ==\nMerchandise from TriStar included trading cards, a stuffed animal, and a tie-in novelization by B.B. Hiller from Scholastic Paperbacks.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nBingo was released on August 9, 1991, opening in 10th place with a gross of $2,141,360. Its total box office take was $8,667,684 from a budget of $10 million, making the film a box office bomb. \n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe film received largely negative reviews. Michael Wilmington of Los Angeles Times said \"Bingo is \"a movie that shouldn't happen to a dog--or an audience, either. It's one more example of how witlessly even the most charming movie cliches can get deformed: a '90s-style Lassie Come Home, transplanted to the era of The Simpsons, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The NFL Today.\" The Washington Times gave Bingo a half-star out of four, and deemed it \"The Problem Child of pet pooch movies.\"\nClifford Terry of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \n\nBased on the children's song (which is sung interminably) and billed as an 'over-the-edge comedy,' Bingo tries to send up the boy-and-his-wonder-dog saga, with such bits as bickering parents...discussions about body odor and houses that are crammed full of NFL trappings, from Bronco lamps to Packer wallpaper. But director Matthew Robbins (Batteries Not Included) frequently resorts to mere absurdity. A particularly heavy bit of overreach occurs in the scene where Bingo testifies in court against the robbers, and then is pawprinted and railroaded to the slammer himself. The result is that, despite the star quality of Bingo the dog (the camera, as they say, loves him), Bingo the movie succeeds neither as a snappy spoof nor as a canine caper.\nVincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"Bingo is a live-action film that has the manner of a cartoon. That it's never as funny as it should be isn't the fault of the human cast. Robert J. Steinmiller Jr., who plays Chuckie, and David Rasche and Cindy Williams, who play Chuckie's sometimes lunatic parents, are good farceurs.\" He criticized the dog's performance as the sort \"that indicates he has been trained within an inch of his life\", and added that the film's comedy \"comes through mostly in scenes that have nothing to do with Bingo, as when Kurt Fuller and Joe Guzaldo, as the dognappers, argue about the civil rights and responsibilities of felons\".\nHal Hinson of The Washington Post, one of few critics to give a positive review, called the film \"a flat-out hoot\". He praised the script for \"breaking off in weird directions\" and said \"Robbins directs the film with a straight-faced style -- call it the Green Acres touch -- as if there were nothing at all unusual about a dog who dials 911 and barks out his message in Morse code\". Hinson concluded Robbins \"holds true to [Bingo's] spirit of absurdist irreverence\" and \"gives us...something that can only be described as canine surrealism\".\nThe Hartford Courant wrote, \"Part Lassie Come Home, part Benji, part Baxter, this dog-road saga comes up with a few waggish twists, as it relentlessly parodies somewhat similar human quest movies. Mostly, though, this is a shaggy-dog misadventure, too dumb and cute for grown-ups, too tasteless and pseudo-sophisticated for family audiences\". Chris Hicks of the Deseret News said, \"Bingo is somewhat inventive, but isn't written well enough to follow through on its ideas. And while rolling through a series of movie cliches, spoofing prison films, courtroom dramas, circus pictures, etc., there is a lethargy that wears down the audience.\"\nIn 2017, Consequence ranked Bingo at number 29 in its list of the 100 Greatest Dogs in Film History.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1991\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBingo at Sony Pictures\nBingo at IMDb\nBingo at Box Office Mojo\nBingo at Rotten Tomatoes",
            "The Biscuit Eater is a 1972 American drama film directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Earl Holliman, Pat Crowley, Lew Ayres, and Godfrey Cambridge. Based on a short story of the same name by James Street, it was released by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the last 'One Boy and his Animal' themed film made by Disney, as this subgenre eventually grew out of fashion. The 1972 film is a remake of a 1940 film starring Billy Lee as Lonnie.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story revolves around a German Wirehaired Pointer named Moreover who has a strong relationship with a boy named Lonnie (Johnny Whitaker). Moreover is given away to Willie Dorsey (Godfrey Cambridge), a gas station clerk, but Lonnie and his best friend Text gain possession of the dog through somewhat deceitful bargaining, securing the reluctant respect of Willie. The boys train Moreover to be a prize-winning bird dog, entering him in a field trial.\nThe dog was initially raised by Lonnie's father, Harvey McNeil, who is an award-winning dog-trainer. Although Lonnie viewed Moreover as a personal pet and a close friend, his father considered the dog to be untrainable and a lackluster hunting dog due to his predilection to eat chicken eggs and biscuits instead of learning to train to be a bird dog. As he did not wish for Moreover to negatively influence the other hunting dogs on the farm, Harvey gifts the dog to Willie, who had previously asked Harvey for a dog to keep as a companion. Lonnie, distraught over the loss of his pet, conspires with his best friend, Text, to trick Willie, who infamously loves to engage in various trades with local individuals, to regain possession of the dog by having Willie trade them the dog for assistance with manual labor. Text, who lives on a farm, takes several eggs from his family's chicken coop to Willie's gas station and gives them to Moreover. Willie, who had initially been hesitant to take possession of the dog due to its reputation of eating eggs, finds Moreover eating the eggs, which he believes to be from his personal stash of eggs, and becomes irate at the dog's behavior. Lonnie and Text are overjoyed that their plan to deceive Willie worked and quickly offer to trade the dog in return for helping Willie carry firewood to his home. Willie agrees to the trade, and the boys decide to secretly train the dog together to become a prize-winning bird dog. Much to the chagrin of Lonnie's father, Lonnie and Text decide to enter Moreover in the state championship field trial.  Moreover does well and an incident makes the boys think that Lonnie's father (Earl Holliman) will lose his dog training job if his dog, last year's champion SilverBelle, loses to their dark horse entry.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe film's score was written by Robert F. Brunner. The film features one original song, \"Moreover and Me,\" written and sung by Shane Tatum. The song plays during the film's opening credits and is reprised at the film's conclusion.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThe Biscuit Eater was released on DVD in the United States by Walt Disney Home Video on May 21, 2002. On November 12, 2019, Disney made The Biscuit Eater available for streaming as part of the launch line-up of its Disney+ service.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nA review in Variety faulted a \"weak screenplay\" but found that Whitaker and Spell \"display confidence and surety, and delineate clear characterizations that make almost plausible the sugary events.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \"a fine Disney family film\" with \"a first-rate cast.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one star out of four and asked, \"What we want to know is, where in the world of space and time is 'The Biscuit Eater' supposed to take place? My preliminary guess is just outside of Never-Never Land sometime between 1850 and 1950 ... I acknowledge that the Disney people prefer to keep their films timeless to permit their perpetual release without being dated. But this time the temporal confusion is downright insulting.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1972\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Biscuit Eater at IMDb\nThe Biscuit Eater at the TCM Movie Database\nUltimate Disney DVD Review",
            "The Black Stallion is a 1979 American adventure film based on the 1941 classic children's novel of the same name by Walter Farley. The film starts in 1946, five years after the book was published. It tells the story of Alec Ramsey, a boy who is shipwrecked on a deserted island with a wild Arabian stallion that he befriends. After being rescued, they are set on entering a race challenging two champion horses.\nThe film is adapted by Melissa Mathison, Jeanne Rosenberg, and William D. Wittliff. It was directed by Carroll Ballard and stars Kelly Reno in his film debut, Teri Garr, Hoyt Axton, Michael Higgins and Mickey Rooney with the Arabian horse Cass Ole playing the eponymous Black Stallion.

Captivated, Alec sneaks to the horse's stall to feed him some sugar cubes, but he is caught by the horse's supposed owner, who tells him in Arabic to stay away from Shetan.\nLater, his father shows Alec his winnings from a card game and gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, telling the story of how Alexander the Great became Bucephalus's master. Later that night, Alec is thrown out of his bunk during a storm. The ship is engulfed in flames and is sinking. In the chaos, Alec makes his way to the black stallion and frees him. The horse then jumps into the sea.

One day, a fishing ship arrives, rescuing the two.\nBack in America, Alec is given a hero's welcome. The Black has a temporary home in his back yard, but a garbage man startles the horse, who races off. The next day, Alec finds the stallion in the barn of Henry Dailey, a retired racehorse jockey. Alec arranges for The Black to stay at the barn.\nWhen Alec wonders how fast the horse is, he and Henry decide to train The Black for the racetrack, while Henry teaches Alec how to be a jockey. The Black surprises Henry with his speed. Henry starts planning to get The Black into a match race between the country's current two champions. To do that, he sets up a secret demonstration at night where a prominent reporter can witness his speed. The news spreads about the mystery horse and The Black is entered into the race.\nBefore the horses enter the starting gate, The Black gets into a fight with one of his opponents, wounding his leg. Alec does not see the injury until he is in the gate. As he begins to dismount, the bell rings and the horses take off. Alec desperately stays on his horse while trying to stop him. He falls far behind, but The Black will not stop. Alec starts urging him to run, and The Black catches his opponents to win.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Horses ===\nCass Ole, a champion Arabian stallion, was featured in most of the movie's scenes, with Fae Jur, another black Arabian stallion, being his main double.

            "The Busy Little Engine is a 2005 American animated adventure short film written and directed by Desmond Mullen. It was selected for the 2006 San Diego International Children's Film Festival and reviewed in the professional library journals Booklist, School Library Journal, and Video Librarian. The Busy Little Engine was picked Best DVD by Parenting Magazine in July 2006.\nThe film takes place in the fictional city of Dinkytown and tells the story of Busy Little Engine, a wooden toy train who pretends to deliver raw materials to a cookie factory. He appears as a wooden toy train in a playroom and as a full-scale CGI train inserted into real-world backgrounds in different parts of the film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film starts off with Busy Little Engine going back and forth through a railroad crossing because he does not know what real trains do. This prompts Pig to ask what trains do, and the narrator explains that trains have a variety of purposes by showcasing different types of railroad cars. In this segment, Pig asks if flatcars carry individual cookies. The narrator explains to Pig that cookies are boxed and carried in boxcars from factories to stores. After explaining to Pig what factories are and how materials from farms go to factories, Pig suggests the idea of going to a farm. This leads the narrator to expand on Pig's idea and suggest that Busy Little Engine pretends to take raw materials from a farm and transport them to a factory. Busy Little Engine obliges. After Busy Little Engine enters a tunnel, the style changes to CGI when he comes out. It can be inferred that this part of the film is in the characters' imaginations.\nWhen Busy Little Engine comes out of the tunnel, he is shown to move through various places, like over a bridge and through a city. When Busy Little Engine arrives at the farm to pick up sugar, Pig and the narrator go to look at farm animals.\nAfter Busy Little Engine is done filling up with sugar, he heads for the flour silo. Instead of showing Busy Little Engine's journey, a montage of American road signs warning of animal crossings plays, with Pig commenting on each one.\nWhen Busy Little Engine arrives at the flour silos, Pig asks why Busy Little Engine doesn't go to a backyard to get flowers. The narrator then explains the difference between flowers and flour to Pig, since they sound alike.\nBusy Little Engine leaves the flour silos and goes immediately to the dairy farm to pick up butter. The narrator explains to Pig, after he asks if Busy Little Engine is going to the grocery store, that they are picking up butter in bulk, along with explaining how butter is made. When Busy Little Engine is done loading butter, they head back to the cookie factory in the playroom, transitioning between real-life scenes like in the beginning of the movie.\nAs Busy Little Engine is heading back, a large train approaches towards him on the same track. The narrator places emphasis on how a railroad switch needs to be flipped in order to let the opposing train pass.\nAfter Busy Little Engine comes out of the tunnel, he pulls into the imaginary cookie factory and pretends to have the ingredients he collected unloaded.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe real-world portions of the film were filmed in Durham and Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDesmond Mullen as Busy Little Engine, the Narrator, and Pig\nLorrie Guess as the Prologue\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Busy Little Engine was selected for the 2006 San Diego International Children's Film Festival. It was picked Best DVD by Parenting Magazine in July 2006.\nInspired in part by Richard Scarry's book, What do People do All Day? and other children's picture books, the DVD uses static framing to its advantage. DVD Verdict's review said:\n\nYet the three kids I've shown it to have been rooted to the screen. Creator Desmond Mullen, formerly of Industrial Light and Magic and a current producer for the Morehead Planetarium, makes an interesting observation: Pans, cuts, and other cinematic shorthand are not natural. We have to learn what they mean. Kids don't intuitively understand that a jump cut means something. Pig's straightforward manner and The Busy Little Engine's static framing mimic the way a child interprets the world. The proof is self evident: Kids dig this DVD.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Busy Little Engine\nThe Busy Little Engine at IMDb",
            "Carnival Magic is a 1983 American film directed by Al Adamson and starring Don Stewart.\nMarketed as a family-oriented children\u2019s film, it has since gained a cult following in underground and B movie film circles owing to its surreal plot and incongruously-adult themes.\nCarnival Magic is Adamson's penultimate film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMarkov the Magnificent is a talented magician and mind-reader whose career is fading.  When he partners with a super-intelligent talking chimp named Alexander the Great, the duo suddenly become a big draw\u2014and the potential savior for their struggling, small-time traveling circus. Markov and fellow workers inside the circus must fend off a jealous, alcoholic tiger-tamer and an evil doctor intent on stealing the chimp.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDon Stewart as Markov\nRegina Carrol as Kate\nJennifer Houlton as Ellen\nHoward Segal as David\nJoe Cirillo as Kirk\nMark Weston as Stoney\nCharles Reynolds as Dr. Poole\nMissy O'Shea as Girl in Car\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrincipal photography took place for the film over the span of three weeks in July 1980 in Gaffney, South Carolina, during that city's South Carolina Peach Festival. Many of the scenes in Gaffney were shot at the peach festival's carnival, its parade, and in a second parade staged for the movie. Additional work for the film was done at the Earl Owensby Studios in Shelby, North Carolina.\nProducer Elvin Feltner and director Al Adamson intended the film as family fare, aimed at children, and it was in fact given a G rating by the MPAA. However, the prevalence of adult themes (alcoholism, sex, abuse, violence) left many viewers confused. The film premiered at the Crosscreek Cinemas in Greenwood, South Carolina, on March 4, 1983, and was also shown in other theatres in the region beginning on that date. By November it had seen a wider release, and was (for example) being shown in New York City.\nThis was the last acting role for Regina Carrol, who was married to director Adamson and featured in several of his films. Philip Morris, a real-life ringmaster, magician, and costume maker, appears as a carnival barker. This was also one of Adamson\u2019s last two films before retiring from the film industry and pursuing a career in real estate.\n\n\n== Revival and re-release ==\nFor two decades Carnival Magic was considered a lost film, and no prints were known to exist. This changed in 2009, when a 35mm print was discovered in a warehouse, sparking a revival of interest among cult film aficionados. Following the discovery of this print, Carnival Magic was restored and re-mastered in 2010, receiving its television debut on Turner Classic Movies in October of that year, as part of their TCM Underground series.  It saw a DVD release in early 2011 from Film Chest and HD Cinema Classics, reissued on Blu-ray and containing bonus material. The bonus material includes out-takes, trailers, audio commentary and interviews with cult film historian Joe Rubin and producer Elvin Feltner.\nThe film was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 as a part of the show's eleventh season, released on April 14, 2017 through Netflix.\n\n\n== Targeted audience ==\nVarious commentators found the film was a \"strange move\" in Adamson's career and that although its targeted audience was allegedly children, the film was not actually shaped to that purpose, one reviewer confessing for instance: \"the G-rated Carnival Magic is the most thematically adult 'kids' film I\u2019ve ever seen\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarnival Magic at IMDb\nCarnival Magic at Rotten Tomatoes\nCarnival Magic overview at Turner Classic Movies\nCarnival Magic on Amazon",
            "Casper is a 1995 American supernatural fantasy comedy film directed by Brad Silberling, in his feature film directorial debut, based on the Harvey Comics cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost created by Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo. The film stars Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, and Eric Idle, with voice talents of Joe Nipote, Joe Alaskey, Brad Garrett, and the film introduction of Malachi Pearson in the title role. The film follows the title character who peacefully haunts a mansion called Whipstaff Manor in Friendship, Maine, meets and befriends a teenage girl named Kat Harvey (Ricci), the daughter of Dr. James Harvey (Pullman), a paranormal therapist who is hired to move into Whipstaff in order to rid the mansion of its spectral inhabitants.\nThe film makes extensive use of computer-generated imagery to create the ghosts, and it is the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in the lead role. It goes for a darker interpretation of Casper in comparison to the previous comics, cartoons and theatrical shorts, notably providing the character a tragic backstory that addresses his death.\nCasper was released in cinemas on May 26, 1995, by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film for its faithfulness to its source material (specifically the title character's portrayal), visual effects, music score, and performances, but criticized its dark tone and humor. The film earned $288 million on a $55 million budget, and spawned two direct-to-video indirect prequels, Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997) and Casper Meets Wendy (1998) as follow-ups to the film and released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and an animated television spin-off, The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFollowing the death of her father, neurotic and spoiled heiress Carrigan Crittenden discovers she has only been left Whipstaff Manor, located in Friendship, Maine, in the will while his vast wealth has gone to several charities. Carrigan and her lawyer and close friend Dibs find a map within the will's papers that tell of an alleged treasure hidden inside the manor, but find the property haunted by a friendly ghost named Casper and his poltergeist uncles the Ghostly Trio. They unsuccessfully attempt to force the ghosts out by way of paranormal experts and a demolitions team. \nA lonely Casper watches a news report about paranormal therapist James Harvey and is instantly smitten with his teenage daughter, Kat, prompting Casper to inspire Carrigan in summoning Harvey to Whipstaff. Kat dislikes her father's reputation and obsession with contacting the ghost of his late wife, Amelia. The Harveys move into Whipstaff, but Casper's attempt to befriend them fails when his uncles try to torment and scare them away, which eventually fails.\nCasper gains the Harveys' trust when he serves them breakfast, and follows Kat to school, where she becomes popular when her class learns she is living in Whipstaff, and agrees to host their Halloween party there. Her classmate Amber plots with her friend, Vic, to humiliate Kat during the party. Harvey attempts therapy sessions with the Ghostly Trio, who reveal they know Amelia; in exchange for convincing Carrigan to leave them alone, they promise to get Harvey a meeting with his wife.\nKat learns Casper has no memory of his life, and restores his old playroom in the attic to remind him. Casper recognizes an old wooden sled his father bought him, and remembers playing outside until he caught a severe cold and died of pneumonia, becoming a ghost to keep his father company. A newspaper article reveals that Casper's father was declared legally insane after he built a machine, the Lazarus, which he claimed could bring the dead back to life. Casper and Kat venture to the basement and find the Lazarus. Carrigan and Dibs sneak inside and steal the formula that powers the machine, plotting to use it to grant themselves immortality. However, they attempt to kill each other to test the theory and retrieve the treasure that they think is in the basement's locked vault. This culminates in Carrigan attempting to run Dibs over with her Range Rover, but instead crashing into a cliff-side tree; upon exiting her car, Carrigan falls to her death and becomes a ghost.\nHarvey becomes depressed after the trio pulls a prank on him, prompting them to take him out on the town. They plan on killing him to make themselves a quartet, but have a change of heart after the drunken therapist declares he will tell Carrigan off so they can stay in their home. However, Harvey accidentally falls to his death.\nIn the laboratory, the ghostly Carrigan confronts Casper and Kat, stealing what she believes to be the treasure from the vault and launching Dibs out a window when he tries to double-cross her. As Carrigan demands to be brought back to life, Casper and Kat trick her into saying that she has no unfinished business on Earth, causing herself to be ejected into the afterlife. The treasure is revealed to be Casper's prized baseball, signed by Duke Snider; the map was part of a game Casper played with his father. Harvey, now a ghost and still in his drunken state, returns with Casper's uncles; after bringing him back to his senses, Kat's despair over this prompts Casper to sacrifice his one chance to return to life, restoring Harvey instead.\nThe Halloween party kicks off upstairs; Amber and Vic's prank is thwarted by the Ghostly Trio, and they flee in terror. A boy dances with Kat, and is revealed to be Casper, temporarily granted physical form by Amelia. Amelia meets with Harvey, explaining that the Ghostly Trio kept their promise to get him a meeting with her, and tells him that she was so content with her family while alive that she has no unfinished business and thus did not become a ghost, but an angel. Amelia departs as the clock chimes ten, promising Harvey that they and Kat will be together again one day; after kissing Kat, Casper transforms back into a ghost, then inadvertently scares Kat's guests away. Kat is nonetheless impressed with the party, and the Ghostly Trio play their nephew's theme for them to dance to.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMalachi Pearson as the voice of Casper McFadden, a lonely ghost who was originally a 12-year-old boy who died of pneumonia.

He saw an episode of the television series Brooklyn Bridge directed by Brad Silberling and saw potential in this work, recruiting Silberling for directing Casper. Alex Proyas had initially signed on as director, but left due to creative differences with the screenplay. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, he claimed that he was intrigued with doing a children's fantasy, and wanted to do a more dark film, akin to The Wizard of Oz.  J. J. Abrams did an uncredited rewrite of the script. The screenplay gave a backstory of Casper being the ghost of Casper McFadden, a boy who died of pneumonia at 12, though some of the comics, particularly in the 1960s, portrayed him as born a ghost to ghost parents.\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 27 and ended on June 8, 1994. Although some location footage was filmed in Camden, Maine, Whipstaff Manor was largely a studio set. Extensive use of computer-generated imagery was used to create the ghosts, and it was the first feature film to have a fully CGI character in a leading role. One 90-second scene with Casper and Ricci took eight months to create. In the mirror scene, Dr. Harvey was also supposed to transform into Spielberg. According to director Silberling, the cameo was filmed, but was cut for pacing reasons. Spielberg was relieved, feeling that he is not much of an actor himself and was nervous in front of the camera.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack was composed by award-winning composer James Horner, who had worked on a number of previous films for Amblin Entertainment, including An American Tail and The Land Before Time. The track \"One Last Wish\" would go on to accompany Universal Pictures' \"Logos Through Time\" Montage, as part of their centennial anniversary. The track \"Descent into Lazarus\" was used in a trailer for How the Grinch Stole Christmas, another film by Universal Pictures and has music by James Horner. The soundtrack was remastered and reissued as a commemorative twenty-fifth anniversary edition by La-La Land Records on August 4, 2020. The soundtrack was originally released however on April 29, 1995, almost five weeks before the film.\n\nAll tracks are performed by James Horner except where noted.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nCasper opened at #1 over the Memorial Day weekend, grossing $16.8 million over its first three days from 2,714 theaters, averaging $6,205 per theater. Over four days it grossed $22.1 million, averaging $8,140 per theater. It stayed at #1 in its second weekend, grossing another $13.4 million, and boosting its 10-day cume to $38.9 million. It played solidly all through the summer, ending up with a final gross of $100.4 million in North America, and an additional $187.6 million internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $288 million, far exceeding its $55 million budget and becoming a commercial success.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nCasper has an approval rating of 52% based on 42 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 5.1/10. Its critical consensus reads: \"A meandering, mindless family movie that frequently resorts to special effects and transparent sappiness\". Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned Casper a score of 49 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"A\" on scale of A to F.\nTime Out London described it as \"an intimate and likeable film\". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it a \"technical achievement, it's impressive, and entertaining. And there is even a little winsome philosophy\". Robert Firsching of AllMovie gave the film his above average star rating while praising the film for its visual effects.\nThe CGI effects, which were considered cutting edge at the time, and the performances of the main cast were praised, especially considering that, in the scenes where the Harveys interact with the ghosts, Pullman and Ricci were actually acting either with nothing or with stand-in maquettes used as animators' references.\nIn his 2015 Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a \"BOMB\" rating, objecting to the portrayal of Casper as a deceased child rather than a ghost.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Home media ==\nCasper debuted on VHS and LaserDisc on October 10, 1995. A DVD release then premiered on September 23, 2003. A Blu-ray version was released on September 2, 2014.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nThe success of Casper secured Silberling the job of directing the 1998 film City of Angels, a remake of Wings of Desire starring Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.\n\n\n=== TV series ===\nA cartoon series, The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper, was released in 1996 based on the film. Fatso (season 1\u20132), Stinkie, Stretch and Casper were all voiced by the actors from the film, while Dr. Harvey was voiced by Dan Castellaneta, and Kat by Kath Soucie.\nIn April 2022, a live-action series was reported to be in development at Peacock.\n\n\n=== Prequels ===\nWith Harvey Entertainment retaining prequel rights to Casper, 20th Century Fox released two direct-to-video follow-ups to the film; an indirect prequel, Casper: A Spirited Beginning (1997), and its sequel Casper Meets Wendy (1998).\n\n\n=== Cancelled sequel ===\nFollowing the release of Casper, Simon Wells co-wrote a screenplay for Casper 2, which he was set to direct. However, in July 2000, Universal Pictures cancelled the sequel due to the disappointing sales from the direct-to-video Casper films and the hesitation of Christina Ricci.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nThere were several video games based on or tied-in with the film released on the major consoles of the time, such as the 3DO, Super NES, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, Game Boy Color and original Game Boy. A Casper game for Sega Genesis was planned but never released. An LCD handheld game was released for Tiger Electronics in 1995.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of ghost films\nList of films set around Halloween\nThe Frighteners\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nCasper at IMDb\nCasper at the TCM Movie Database\nCasper at AllMovie\nCasper at Box Office Mojo",

            "Chasing 3000 is a 2007 American independent film chronicling the cross-country travel of two brothers to see the 3,000th base hit of Major League Baseball legend Roberto Clemente. It stars Trevor Morgan, Rory Culkin, Ray Liotta, and Lauren Holly. The film was originally meant to premiere at the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, but its release was delayed until April 2007.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1972, Roberto Clemente is close to making his 3,000th hit. High school student Mickey (Trevor Morgan) and his younger brother Roger (Rory Culkin) drive to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles with a learner's permit to attend the baseball game. Roger has muscular dystrophy, but that does not deter them from traveling with their grandfather (Seymour Cassel). Their mother (Lauren Holly) follows them and they are later helped by a runaway, a motorcycle gang leader, a farmer, and an emergency room doctor.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally meant to premiere at the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, but the filmmakers changed their minds because they wanted a better chance of securing a distribution deal. It cost less than $3 million to produce the film. The film's producer Ryan Johnson gave the script to actor Ray Liotta's business agent. When Liotta read the script, he said that he could relate to it and wanted a part in the film. Liotta joining the film as an actor caused other actors to join the production. It was originally intended to have a straight to DVD release, but the filmmakers changed their mind once Liotta had a role. Bill Mikita began to write the screenplay in 1999 and he decided to add Clemente's 3,000th hit to the script because he and his brother Steve are major fans of the athlete. The film was based on Mikita and his brother's own cross-country trip to the game.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film had its debut on April 29, 2007 at the AMC Loews 34th Street Theater. It was shown at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2007 and former Vice President Al Gore hosted the gala on opening night. The DVD release date was on September 28, 2010.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAndrew Barker of Variety wrote, \"A brotherly love tale substantially weightier than its baseball road-trip premise might indicate, Chasing 3000 overcomes some heavy-handed moments and narrative shortcuts with a surprising degree of emotional honesty\". Bob Hoover, writing for Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stated, \"Its earnestness and innocence carries Chasing 3000 a long way, and its sweet appreciation of the 'Burgh will win over local hearts.\"\nMichael Ordona of the Los Angeles Times gave a mixed review, stating, \"This sincere, nostalgic, brothers-on-the-road movie has its strong points but sadly fails to do what Clemente so famously did in his final at-bat\u2014finish on a high note\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of baseball films\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChasing 3000 at IMDb\nChasing 3000 at Rotten Tomatoes\nPost-Gazette story",
            "Cheetah, also known as Cheetah and Friends, is a 1989 American family drama film from Walt Disney Pictures starring Keith Coogan and Lucy Deakins. This motion picture was loosely based on Alan Caillou's novel The Cheetahs. It was shot in Nairobi, Kenya. This motion picture features the phrase \"Hakuna matata\" which became famous when Disney released The Lion King five years later.\nIt was first screened alongside a re-issue of the 1948 animated short, Mickey and the Seal.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLos Angeles siblings Ted and Susan Johnson join their parents in Kenya where their father, Earl, works at a NASA tracking station, and their mother, Jean, works at a clinic. Ted's dreams of roughing it on the Savannah are squashed when their mother leads him into a house that looks like it belongs in Pasadena, California. Although she forbids her children to explore, Ted and Susan sneak out to a nearby watering hole, where they meed a friendly Masai boy named Morogo. Morogo shows the siblings the wildlife of Kenya and they teach him how to play video games. One day, their mother comes home to discover Morogo in her home and they convince their parents that Morogo will keep them safe, which their parents reluctantly agree.\nOne day, Ted kicks a soccer ball over a barrier and it lands against a sleeping rhino. Morogo sneaks up on the animal, retrieves the ball, and places a small stone on the rhino\u2019s side. He then gives Ted another stone, daring him to do the same. The rhino awakens as Ted nears, causing him to flee. Kipoin, Morogo's father, scolds him for neglecting his goat herding duties and Morogo says that he will take care of his duties, but he has been learning new stuff from his friends, to which he detests about his new friends, because they are different.\nOne day, the trio comes across a cheetah cub whose mother has been killed by a poacher. Susan insists they take the cub home as it's the only way for her to survive and their parents reluctantly decide to keep her, where she becomes the household pet. Six months later, however, the Johnson family convince the children to free Duma and train her to hunt according to the advice of an Australian game warden named Larry before their vacation is over.\nMeanwhile, an Indian storekeeper named B. Patel (who had unsuccessfully tried to buy Duma) hires an opportunistic Englishman named Nigel and a ruthless poacher named Abdullah, who are planning to make a fortune out of Duma by exploiting her speed in a prolific sport of racing against greyhounds. The night before Ted and Susan are to leave Africa, Patel breaks into the house to steal Ted's whistle and the three gamblers manage to capture Duma. The next morning, the family say goodbye to Morogo and stop at Patel's store. Patel accidentally reveals his whereabouts to Ted and he notices similar markings on Abdullah's shoes, indicating that he was the poacher who killed Duma's mother. Ted tries to convince his parents about Patel's conspiracy, to no avail, so the kids miss their flight after sending a telegram to their grandmother and learn Patel's whereabouts from his cousin that he is working in a camp in Jamhuri. The children convince Morogo to save Duma, but he fears that he can't go and gives them directions to Jamhuri. The next morning, Morogo sneaks away as well and decides to help them rescue Duma.\nHowever, Morogo's parents have learned about their disappearances and inform Ted and Susan's parents. Earl calls his mother and she informs him about the telegram the siblings sent to her. The parents call the police and their wives insist on heading out to find the children themselves. Meanwhile, the children arrive at the camp and sneak in at nightfall. They manage to find Duma, but are captured by the poachers and locked in a cage. While they leave for the race, Morogo unlocks the cage and they head after the poachers to Nairobi.\nThey head off after the poachers to Nairobi, only to be caught by the policemen roaming the roads for them. They escape, due to the inattentiveness of the policeman and finally make it to Nairobi with the help of a sheep farmer. The children reach the racetrack in time to hear the cheetah-greyhound race being announced. In the race, Duma has now been overtaken by greyhounds, with greater resistance (as predicted by Patel, who had given up losing in bets) but is revived in reviewing his masters and resumed to race winning. Ted grabs his whistle from a security guard and blows it, allowing Duma to regain her burst of speed and win. While the other gamblers must compensate all bets, Duma rebels against Abdullah and attacks him until she is rescued by Earl. While both sets of parents berate their children for leaving them, the poacher is arrested.\nThe families arrive at Cheetah Valley to release Duma and notice another cheetah. They refuse to extend their parents' proposal for the holiday and they try to release Duma, but the stubborn cheetah refuses to leave until Susan manages to convince her to leave. The children quote a Kenyan adage by Morogo \"Though we are far apart, our spirits share the same earth and the same sky\" as they happily watch Duma play with her newfound friend.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nKeith Coogan as Ted Johnson\nLucy Deakins as Susan Johnson\nCollin Mothupi as Morogo\nTimothy Landfield as Earl Johnson\nBreon Gorman-Landfield as Jean Johnson\nMhlangabezi Ka Vundla as Kipoin\nLydia Kigada as Lani\nKuldeep Bhakoo as Mr. Patel\nPaul Onsongo as Abdullah\nAnthony Baird as Nigel\nRory McGuinness as Larry\nRod Jacobsen as David\nDavid Adido as Mwangi\nKonga Mbandu as Police Captain\nMartin Okello as Friendly Policeman\nAllaudin Qureshi as Patel's Cousin\nWilliam Tsuma as Cabbie\nWaigwa Wachira as Racetrack Policeman\nJim Ward as Announcer\nJan MacCoy as Stewardess\nEvalyne Kamau as Nyambura\nJane Gelardi as Announcer's Girlfriend\n'J.J.'

            "Cool Cat Saves the Kids is a 2015 American independent family film. It was the feature-length directorial debut of Derek Savage, who was also the film's writer and producer. It is based on Savage's Cool Cat children's book series. The film is an anti-bullying movie aimed at children featuring Vivica A. Fox and Erik Estrada, as well as Savage himself and other lesser-known actors. Part of the film was funded through Kickstarter. The film was near-universally panned by Internet reviewers.\nIn the film, Cool Cat, an anthropomorphic cat, teaches children about topics such as how to deal with bullying and gun safety. The film uses footage from three Cool Cat shorts Savage had previously created: Cool Cat Stops Bullying, Cool Cat in the Christmas Parade and Cool Cat Finds a Gun.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nCool Cat is making signs for his school president campaign with one of his friends, Maria, when Maria receives a text from a number she doesn't recognize. Cool Cat entices Maria to open the message, despite not knowing who sent it \u2013 it reads that Maria is ugly and has rat hair. After several more exchanges, they discover that Butch the Bully, a neighborhood kid lurking behind a car nearby, sent the text.\nButch runs away laughing and finds a can of spray paint, which he uses to ruin one of Cool Cat's signs. However, the wind forces some of the spray into Butch's eyes, forcing him to run away again. Butch enlists the help of two other boys, Jamie and Serge, to vandalize the neighborhood.\nUpon discovering this, Cool Cat runs to confront the three about their behavior, causing Butch to flee and leave the spray can with the other two boys. When the boys are asked why they are doing what Butch says, they say it is because no one loves them. Cool Cat tells them that it isn't true, and that he loves them.\nAfter arriving home and saying goodbye to Maria, Cool Cat heads upstairs to check his e-mails, and discovers that someone has sent him hate mail. Cool Cat tells the bully \"If you were nice, you would have more friends, and friends are cool\", with the bully replying that they will \"get him tomorrow\". Cool Cat freaks out about what the bully might do to him, causing him to have a nightmare. He arrives at the solution of standing up for himself.\nOn the next day, Cool Cat gets invited to be in the Hollywood Christmas Parade. He asks his parents, Daddy Derek and Momma Cat, if he can go, and they say yes. Cool Cat and Daddy Derek compose and perform a rock song (\"Cool Cat Loves to Rock\"), and make a music video (\"Cool Cat Boogie\"). The two then participate in the Hollywood Parade together.\nAt a barbecue hosted by Vivica A. Fox and Erik Estrada, Cool Cat and Maria build a sandcastle, but Butch knocks it down, causing Cool Cat to feel sad and confused. Fox and Estrada give Cool Cat advice on how to stand up to bullies. When Butch returns demanding lunch money, Cool Cat stands up to Butch for the first time, yelling at Butch and causing him to run away. Cool Cat then goes home and learns of a kids writing contest from one of Daddy Derek's \"entertainment magazines\".\nSome time later, Cool Cat and his friends hear a radio alert that someone is stealing candy from babies. They identify Butch as the culprit. Cool Cat chases Butch down, and Butch gets arrested by a police officer. Cool Cat and his friends then find a gun in the grass. They decide to tell Daddy Derek about it, but Butch (now released from custody) steals the gun, planning to extort kids at school out of their lunch money. Daddy Derek learns of Butch's plans and calls Butch's parents. The following morning, Daddy Derek escorts Cool Cat and his friends to school, where they see Butch showing off the gun to Jamie. The police officer arrives at the scene and arrests Butch and Jamie.\nCool Cat wins his election for school president, as well as the writing contest, for which he receives $100. The film ends with Cool Cat, Maria and Jamie sitting around a table and talking about what they learned.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nJason Johnson as Cool Cat\nDerek Savage as Daddy Derek\nErik Estrada as himself\nVivica A.

The 2022 Director's Cut notably re-dubs Cool Cat's voice acting with Derek Savage as the voice of Cool Cat.\nIn 2021 a new Cool Cat short, Cool Cat Fights Coronavirus, was released. A feature-length sequel, Cool Cat vs Dirty Dog - The Virus Wars, was released for streaming digitally on December 16, 2023. Another proposed feature-length sequel, Cool Cat Stops a School Shooting, has been floated by Savage.\nSavage released another gun safety-related film, Gun Self-Defense for Women, in 2016, which was instead aimed at adults. Footage from \"Cool Cat Saves The Kids\" was included in this movie. It was also later released again as \"Gun Self-Defense for Ladies - and for Men too\" and \"Guns, Knives, Mace - Self-Defense for All\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCool Cat Saves the Kids only had a home media release, and it did not receive significant mainstream media coverage. It was panned by Internet reviewers, with some considering it among the worst movies ever made, as well as a source of ironic enjoyment. The 2018 re-release Cool Cat Kids Superhero was reviewed by PewDiePie in 2019 as part of his Cringe Tuesdays series. In 2023, users of the movie social network Letterboxd voted Cool Cat Saves the Kids as number 9 on its list of \"10 Best 'So Bad, It's Good' Movies\".\nIn response to a negative review on the popular YouTube channel I Hate Everything, Derek Savage demanded that the review be deleted and put a YouTube copyright strike on the channel. Savage subsequently continued to harass the channel's owner, Alex Bolton, and threatened to file a lawsuit if the review was reuploaded. Bolton also claimed that Savage had emailed him impersonating a lawyer. Jim Vorel of Paste Magazine criticized Savage's actions, and argued that the review's use of movie clips was protected under the fair use doctrine of U.S. copyright law.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films considered the worst\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCool Cat Saves the Kids at IMDb",

            "Enchanted is a 2007 American live-action/animated musical fantasy romantic comedy film directed by Kevin Lima and written by Bill Kelly. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Josephson Entertainment, and Right Coast Productions, the film stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, and Susan Sarandon, with Julie Andrews as the narrator. It focuses on an archetypal Disney princess-to-be named Giselle exiled from her animated world into the live-action world of New York City.\nThe film is both a homage to and a self-parody of Disney's animated features, making numerous references to past works through the combination of live-action filmmaking, traditional animation, and computer-generated imagery. It also marks the return of traditional animation to a Disney feature film after the company's decision to move entirely to computer animation in 2004. Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had written songs for previous Disney films, wrote and produced the songs of Enchanted, and Menken also composed the film's score. The animated sequences were produced at James Baxter Animation in Pasadena, while filming of the live-action segments took place around New York City.\nEnchanted premiered at the London Film Festival on October 20, 2007, and went into its wide release in the United States on November 21. It was critically well-received, established Adams as a leading lady, and earned more than $340 million worldwide at the box office. It won three Saturn Awards, Best Fantasy Film, Best Actress for Adams and Best Music for Menken. Enchanted also received two nominations at the 65th Golden Globe Awards and three Best Original Song nominations at the 80th Academy Awards. This is the first Walt Disney Pictures film to be distributed under the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures banner after Disney retired the Buena Vista brand from its distribution division.\nA sequel, Disenchanted, was released on Disney+ on November 18, 2022.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the animated fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia, the corrupt and ruthless Queen Narissa is determined to stay in power; her reign will end if her stepson, Prince Edward, ever gets married. Narissa enlists her loyal servant, Nathaniel, to help Edward hunt trolls to distract Edward from searching for his true love.\nA young woman named Giselle lives in a forest and dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \"happily ever after.\" Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured troll to kill Giselle, but Edward rescues her. She and Edward are instantly attracted to each other and plan to be married the following day.\nNarissa disguises herself as an old hag, intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding, and pushes her into a well. Giselle is transformed into a live-action version of herself and transported to New York City's Times Square. Giselle becomes frightened and overwhelmed by the harshness and unfamiliarity of her new environment.\nMeanwhile, Robert Philip, a divorce lawyer, plans to propose to his girlfriend, Nancy. Robert and his young daughter, Morgan, encounter Giselle. Robert reluctantly allows Giselle to stay in his apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes Giselle is a princess.\nEdward embarks on a mission to save Giselle, along with Giselle's chipmunk friend Pip; they jump down the well, turn into live-action versions of themselves, and emerge in Times Square. To his dismay, Pip discovers he cannot speak in the real world. Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow Edward and sabotage his efforts to find Giselle. Narissa gives Nathaniel three poisoned apples. Whoever eats one of the apples will sleep until midnight; unless they are awoken before midnight, they will die.\nNancy arrives to take Morgan to school. After seeing Giselle, Nancy assumes Robert has been unfaithful to her and leaves. Robert is initially angry at Giselle, but he ends up spending the day with her to help familiarize her with the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending her flowers and an invitation to a costume ball at the Woolworth Building.\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment. Although he is eager to take her home to Andalasia and marry her, she suggests they should first go on a date and get to know each other better. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after the ball that night, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Nathaniel attempts to give Giselle a poisoned apple twice, but his attempts fail, so Narissa decides to enter the real world and kill Giselle herself.\nAt the ball, Robert and Giselle dance together. Giselle and Edward prepare to depart, but Giselle begins to feel guilty and anguished for leaving Robert behind. Shortly before midnight, Narissa appears as the old hag and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising that it will erase her memories of Robert. She takes a bite and immediately falls into a deep sleep.\nNarissa tries escaping with Giselle's body, but Edward thwarts her. Realizing that Narissa never cared about him, Nathaniel reveals her plot and apologizes for his previous actions. Robert realizes that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's curse. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and he realizes Robert should kiss Giselle instead. Robert is hesitant to do so until Nancy, despite being heartbroken, gives him her permission.\nRobert kisses Giselle, causing her to awaken. Infuriated, Narissa transforms into a dragon and takes Robert hostage. Giselle takes Edward's sword and pursues Narissa to the top of the building to rescue Robert. Pip comes to support Giselle and causes Narissa to fall to her death on the streets below. Robert almost falls as well, but Giselle rescues him, and they share another kiss.\nEdward and Nancy fall in love and get married in Andalasia. Nathaniel, who stays in New York, and Pip, who returns to Andalasia, each write autobiographies based on their experiences in the real world. Giselle begins dating Robert and starts a fashion design business, which becomes very successful.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nAmy Adams as Giselle: A singing and dancing princess-to-be who ends up almost having her dream of meeting her prince a reality. Adams was announced to have been cast in the role of Giselle on November 14, 2005. Although the studio was looking for a film star in the role, director Kevin Lima insisted on casting a lesser-known actress. Out of the 300 or so actresses who auditioned for the role, Adams stood out to Lima because not only did she look like a Disney princess but her \"commitment to the character, her ability to escape into the character's being without ever judging the character was overwhelming\". Hailing from Andalasia, Giselle displays similar traits to early Disney Princesses; Lima describes her as \"about 80% Snow White, with some traits borrowed from Cinderella and Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty... although her spunkiness comes from Ariel from The Little Mermaid\". She is \"eternally optimistic and romantic\" but is also \"very independent and true to her convictions\". Over the course of the film, she becomes more mature (even stopping her habit of singing in a continuous manner) but maintains her fondness of singing, kindness, innocence and optimism.\nPatrick Dempsey as Robert Philip: A cynical Manhattan divorce attorney at Churchill, Harline & Smith LLP who does not believe in true love, happily-ever-after, or fairy tales since his wife left him and their daughter. He falls in love with Giselle after her adventure to New York City, and her sense of fun gradually rubs off on him over the course of the film. Lima cast Dempsey after Disney was satisfied with the casting of Adams but had wanted more well-known actors in the film. Dempsey, whose starring role on TV series Grey's Anatomy had earned him the nickname \"McDreamy\", was described by Lima as \"a modern-day Prince Charming to today's audience\". The role was challenging for Dempsey because he had to play the straight man to Adams' and Marsden's more outrageous characters.\nJames Marsden as Prince Edward: A dim-witted, yet brave, heroic and good-hearted, prince who is baffled by the world of New York once he enters it. Marsden was announced to have been cast on December 6, 2005. At the time Marsden was auditioning, the role of Robert had not been cast but he decided to pursue the role of Prince Edward because he was \"more fun and he responded more to that character\". Edward is a prince in Andalasia and the stepson of Queen Narissa. He is \"very pure, very simple-minded and naive, but innocently narcissistic\".\nTimothy Spall as Nathaniel: A servant of Queen Narissa, who gets controlled through his infatuation with the Queen and his own lack of self-esteem. He initially does Narissa's bidding, but ultimately realizes her true nature and rebels against her. He has a penchant for disguises.\nIdina Menzel as Nancy Tremaine: A fashion designer and Robert's girlfriend. Once Giselle falls in love with Robert, she falls for Edward and leaves with him. Since the role did not require any singing, Menzel said in an interview that \"it was a compliment to be asked to just be hired on my acting talents alone\". She is named after Lady Tremaine, the stepmother from Cinderella.\nRachel Covey as Morgan Philip: Robert's 6-year-old daughter. Despite her father misunderstanding her and telling her otherwise, she believes in fairy tales and also believes that magic exists.\nSusan Sarandon as Queen Narissa: Edward's evil stepmother, a sorceress, and a megalomaniac with a hatred for Giselle simply for being an obstacle for her to keep her power. Sarandon had been attracted to the project prior to Lima's involvement as director. Since Sarandon's on-screen time was relatively short, it took only two weeks to film her scenes. Narissa's mannerisms, characteristics, powers, and physical features were inspired by such classical Disney villainesses as the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.\nGiselle's chipmunk friend Pip is voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia, where he has no trouble expressing himself through speech, while Enchanted director Kevin Lima voices Pip in the real world, where he must communicate through squeaks and charades. Much of Pip's personality were based on Disney sidekicks such as Mushu from Mulan and Timon from The Lion King. The Andalasia cast also includes Lima's daughter Emma Rose Lima as the bluebird and the fawn, Teala Dunn as a bunny and Fred Tatasciore as the troll. Julie Andrews provides the film's narration.\nPaige O'Hara and Judy Kuhn make cameo appearances as soap opera character Angela and a pregnant woman Edward encounters, respectively. John Rothman and Jodi Benson portray, respectively, Robert's boss Carl and secretary Sam, while Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr. portray Phoebe and Ethan Banks, a couple whose divorce Robert is mediating. Marlon Saunders and Jon McLaughlin appear as vocalists who sing \"That's How You Know\" and \"So Close\", respectively.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe initial script of Enchanted, written by Bill Kelly, was bought by Disney's Touchstone Pictures and Sonnenfeld/Josephson Productions for a reported sum of $450,000 in September 1997. The script was written for three years, but it was thought to be unsuitable for Walt Disney Pictures because it was \"a racier R-rated movie\", inspired by the adult-risque comedy movies in the 1980s and 1990s such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and American Pie. The first draft of the script had Giselle being mistaken for a stripper when she arrives in New York City. To the frustration of Kelly, the screenplay was rewritten several times, first by Rita Hsiao and then by Todd Alcott. The film was initially scheduled to be released in 2002 with Rob Marshall as director but he withdrew due to \"creative differences\" between the producers and him. In 2001, director Jon Turteltaub was set to direct the film but he left soon after, later working with Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer on the National Treasure franchise. Adam Shankman became the film's director in 2003, while Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle were hired by Disney to rewrite the script once again. At the time, Disney considered offering the role of Giselle to Kate Hudson or Reese Witherspoon. However, the project did not take off.\nOn May 25, 2005, Variety reported that Kevin Lima had been hired as director and Bill Kelly had returned to the project to write a new version of the script. Lima worked with Kelly on the script to combine the main plot of Enchanted with the idea of a \"loving homage\" to Disney's heritage. He created visual storyboard printouts that covered the story of Enchanted from beginning to end, which filled an entire floor of a production building. After Lima showed them to Dick Cook, the chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, he received the green light for the project and a budget of $85 million. Lima began designing the world of Andalasia and storyboarding the movie before a cast was chosen to play the characters. After the actors were hired, he was involved in making the final design of the movie, which made sure the animated characters look like their real-life counterparts.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nEnchanted is the first feature-length Disney live-action/traditional animation hybrid since Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, though the traditionally animated characters do not interact in the live-action environment in the same method as they did in Roger Rabbit; however, there are some scenes where live-action characters share the screen with two-dimensional animated characters, for example, a live-action Nathaniel communicating with a cel-drawn Narissa, who is in a cooking pot. The film uses two aspect ratios; it begins in 2.35:1 when the Walt Disney Pictures logo and Enchanted storybook are shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the first animated sequence. The film switches back to 2.35:1 when it becomes live-action and never switches back, even for the remainder of the animated sequences. When this movie was aired on televised networks, the beginning of the movie (minus the Walt Disney Pictures logo and opening credits) was shown in the pillarboxed 4:3 aspect ratio; the remainder of the movie was shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio when it becomes live-action. The fullscreen version uses the 4:3 format during the entire movie, while the open matte version retains the letterboxed 1.85:1 format for the first animated sequence then switches to an open matted 1.85:1 format for the rest of the movie when it switches to live-action. Lima oversaw the direction of both the live-action and animation sequences, which were being produced at the same time  Enchanted took almost two years to complete. The animation took about a year to finish while the live-action scenes, which commenced filming on location in New York City during the summer of 2006 and were completed during the animation process, were shot in 72 days.\n\n\n==== Animation ====\nOut of the film's 107 minutes of running time, ten of the approximately 13 minutes of animation are at the beginning of the film. Lima tried to \"cram every single piece of Disney iconic imagery\" that he could into the first ten minutes, which were done in traditional cel animation (in contrast to computer-generated imagery 3-D animation) as a tribute to past Disney fairy tale films such as Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was the first Disney film theatrically released in America to feature traditional cel animation since Pooh's Heffalump Movie (2005). This film, although quite different in terms of plot from any previous Disney film, also contained obvious homages to other Disney films of the distant past, such as Old Yeller, The Shaggy Dog, Swiss Family Robinson, Bon Voyage!, and Savage Sam. As most of Disney's traditional animation artists were laid off after the computer graphics boom of the late 1990s, the 13 minutes of animation were not done in-house but by the independent Pasadena-based company James Baxter Animation, founded by former Disney animator Baxter.\nAlthough Lima wanted the animation to be nostalgic, he wanted Enchanted to have a style of its own. Baxter's team decided to use Art Nouveau as a starting point. For Giselle, the hand-drawn animated character had to be \"a cross between Amy Adams and a classic Disney princess. And not a caricature.\" Seeing Giselle as \"a forest girl, an innocent nymph with flowers in her hair\" and \"a bit of a hippie\", the animators wanted her to be \"flowing, with her hair and clothes. Delicate.\" For Prince Edward, Baxter's team \"worked the hardest on him to make him look like the actor\" because princes \"in these kinds of movies are usually so bland.\" Many prototypes were made for Narissa as Baxter's team wanted her face to \"look like Susan Sarandon. And the costumes had to align closely to the live-action design.\"\nTo maintain continuity between the two media, Lima brought in costume designer Mona May during the early stages of the film's production so the costumes would be aligned in both the animated and live-action worlds. He also shot some live-action footage of Amy Adams as Giselle for the animators to use as reference, which also allowed the physical movement of the character to match in both worlds. Test scenes completed by the animators were shown to the actors, allowing them to see how their animated selves would move.\n\n\n==== Live-action ====\n\nPrincipal photography began in April 2006 and ended in July. Because of the sequence setting, the live action scenes were filmed in New York City. However, shooting in New York became problematic as it was in a \"constant state of new stores, scaffolding and renovation\".\nThe first scene in New York, which features Giselle emerging from a manhole in the middle of Times Square, was filmed on location in the center of the square. Because of the difficulties in controlling the crowd while filming in Times Square, general pedestrians were featured in the scene with hired extras placed in the immediate foreground. Similarly, a crowd gathered to watch as James Marsden and Timothy Spall filmed their scenes in Times Square. However, the scene Lima found the most challenging to shoot was the musical number, \"That's How You Know\", in Central Park. The five-minute scene took 17 days to finish due to the changing weather, which allowed only seven sunny days for the scene to be filmed. The filming was also hampered at times by Patrick Dempsey's fans. The scene was choreographed by John O'Connell, who had worked on Moulin Rouge! beforehand, and included 300 extras and 150 dancers.\nMany scenes were filmed at Steiner Studios, which provided the three large stages that Enchanted needed at the same facility. Other outdoor locations included the Brooklyn Bridge and The Paterno, an apartment building with a curved, heavily embellished, ivory-colored fa\u00e7ade located on the corner of Riverside Drive and 116th Street, which is the residence of the film's characters Robert and Morgan.\n\n\n=== Costume design ===\n\nAll the costumes in the film were designed by Mona May, who had previously worked on Clueless (1995), The Wedding Singer (1998), and The Haunted Mansion (2003). To create the costumes, May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of twenty people, while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City. She became involved in the project during the time when the animators were designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to \"translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion\". Her goal was to keep the designs \"Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new\". However, May admitted this was difficult \"because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters who have been in the psyche of the viewing audience for so long\".\nFor the character of Giselle, her journey to becoming a real woman is reflected in her dresses, which become less fairy tale-like as the film progresses. Her wedding dress at the beginning of the film directly contrasts her modern gown at the end of the film. The wedding dress served to provide a \"humongous contrast to the flat drawings\" and to accentuate the image of a Disney Princess. In order to make the waist look small, the sleeves are designed to be \"extremely pouffy\" and the skirt to be as big as possible, which included a metal hoop that holds up twenty layers of petticoats and ruffles. Altogether, eleven versions of the dress were made for filming, each made of 200 yards (183 m) of silk satin and other fabric, and weighing approximately 40 pounds (18 kg). On the experience of wearing the wedding dress, Amy Adams described it as \"grueling\" since \"the entire weight was on her hips, so occasionally it felt like she was in traction\".\nUnlike Giselle, Prince Edward does not adapt to the real world and James Marsden, who plays Edward, had only one costume designed for him. May's aim was to try \"not to lose Marsden in the craziness of the outfit... where he still looks handsome\". The costume also included padding in the chest, buttocks, and crotch, which gave Marsden the \"same exaggerated proportions as an animated character\" and \"posture \u2013 his back is straight, the sleeves are up and never collapse\".\nMay was delighted that Lima \"went for something more fashion-forward\" with Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa. She decided to make her look like a \"runway lady\", wearing something that is \"still Disney\" but also \"high fashion, like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design\". Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May had to make sure that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of \"color, shape, and texture\". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked \"reptilian\", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the layers of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe film's score was written by accomplished songwriter and composer Alan Menken, who has worked on a number of Disney films previously. Fellow composer Stephen Schwartz wrote the lyrics for six songs, also composed by Menken. Menken and Schwartz previously worked together on the songs for Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\nMenken became involved with the film in the early stages of the film's development and invited Schwartz to resume their collaboration. They began the songwriting process by searching for the right moments in the story in which a song moment was allowed. Schwartz found that it was easier to justify situations in which the characters would burst into songs in Enchanted than in other live-action musicals as its concept \"allowed the characters to sing in a way that was completely integral to the plot of the story.\" The three songs Giselle sings contain references to earlier Disney films. The first song played in the film, \"True Love's Kiss\", was written to be \"a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features\", namely, \"I'm Wishing\" (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and \"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\" (Cinderella), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved. It posed a challenge for Menken and Schwartz because of the \"many preconceptions with that number\"; it had to be reflective of the era of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.\nBoth \"Happy Working Song\" and \"That's How You Know\" also pay tributes to past Disney songs and movies. \"Happy Working Song\" pays a lyrical homage to such songs as \"Whistle While You Work\" (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), \"The Work Song\" (Cinderella), \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" (Mary Poppins) and \"Making Christmas\" (The Nightmare Before Christmas), and a musical homage to the Sherman Brothers (with a self-parodic \"Alan Menken style\" middle eight). \"That's How You Know\" is a self-parody of Menken's compositions for his Disney features, specifically such big production numbers as \"Under the Sea\" (The Little Mermaid) and \"Be Our Guest\" (Beauty and the Beast). To achieve this, Schwartz admitted he had to \"push it a little bit further in terms of choices of words or certain lyrics\" while maintaining \"the classic Walt Disney sensibility\". However, Menken noted that the songs he has written for Disney have always been \"a little tongue-in-cheek\". As the film progresses, the music uses more contemporary styles, which is heard through the adult ballad \"So Close\" and the country/pop number \"Ever Ever After\" (sung by Carrie Underwood as a voice-over).\nOut of the six completed songs written and composed by Menken and Schwartz, five remained in the finished film. The title song, \"Enchanted,\" a duet featuring Idina Menzel and James Marsden, was the only song of Menken's and Schwartz's authorship and composition that was deleted from the movie.\n\n\n=== Effects ===\nThe majority of the visual effects shots in Enchanted were done by Tippett Studio in Berkeley, California, who contributed a total of 320 shots. These shots involved virtual sets, environmental effects and CGI characters that performed alongside real actors, namely the animated animals during the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, Pip and the Narissa dragon during the live-action portions of the film. CIS Hollywood was responsible for 36 visual effects shots, which primarily dealt with wire removals and composites. Reel FX Creative Studios did four visual effects shots involving the pop-up book page-turn transitions while Weta Digital did two.\nOut of all the animals that appear in the \"Happy Working Song\" sequence, the only real animals filmed on set were rats and pigeons. The real animals captured on film aided Tippett Studio in creating CGI rats and pigeons, which gave dynamic performances such as having pigeons that carried brooms in their beaks and rats that scrubbed with toothbrushes. On the other hand, all the cockroaches were CGI characters.\nPip, a chipmunk who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia, loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures. This meant the animators had to display Pip's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk. The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \"every conceivable angle\", after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software, Maya and Furrocious. When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima, he was surprised that he was a looking at a CG character and not reference footage. To enhance facial expressions, the modelers gave Pip eyebrows, which real chipmunks do not have. During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears, a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip. On some occasions, a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene. In other situations, a rod with a small marker on the end or a laser pointer would be used to show the actors and cinematographer where Pip is.\nUnlike Pip, the Narissa dragon was allowed to be more of a fantasy character while still looking like a living character and a classic Disney villain. The CGI dragon design was loosely based on a traditional Chinese dragon and Susan Sarandon's live-action witch. When filming the scene which sees the transformation of Narissa from a woman into a dragon, a long pole was used to direct the extras' eyelines instead of a laser pointer. Set pieces were made to move back and forth in addition to having a computer-controlled lighting setup and a repeatable head on the camera that were all synchronized. In the film's final sequence, in which Narissa climbs the Woolworth Building while clutching Robert in her claws, a greenscreen rig was built to hold Patrick Dempsey in order to film his face and movements. The rig was a \"puppeteering\" approach that involved a robotic arm being controlled by three different floor effects artists.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to 3,730 theaters in the United States. It was distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures International to over 50 territories around the world and topped the box office in several countries including the United Kingdom and Italy. It is the first movie to be released under the Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures name following the retirement of the previous Buena Vista Pictures Distribution.\n\n\n=== Merchandising ===\nDisney had originally planned to add Giselle to the Disney Princess line-up, as it was shown at a 2007 Toy Fair where the Giselle doll was featured with packaging declaring her with Disney Princess status, but decided against it when they realized they would have to pay for lifelong rights to Amy Adams' image. While Giselle is not being marketed as one of the Disney Princesses, Enchanted merchandise was made available in various outlets with Adams' animated likeness being used on all Giselle merchandise. Giselle led the 2007 Hollywood Holly-Day Parade at Disney's Hollywood Studios. She was also featured in the 2007 Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade in the Magic Kingdom with the official Disney Princesses.\nA video game based on the film was released for Nintendo DS and mobile phones in addition to a Game Boy Advance title, Enchanted: Once Upon Andalasia, which is a prequel to the film, about Giselle and Pip rescuing Andalasia from a magic spell.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nEnchanted was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on March 18, 2008, in the United States. While Enchanted topped the DVD sales chart on the week of its release in the United States, narrowly defeating the DVD sales of I Am Legend, the Blu-ray Disc sales of I Am Legend were nearly four times the number of Blu-ray Disc sales of Enchanted. Overall, Enchanted was the eighth best-selling film on home video with 5.3 million units sold and earning a revenue of $86.3 million. The DVD was released in United Kingdom and Europe on April 7, 2008, Australia on May 21, 2008 and in other 50 international countries on 2008.\nThe bonus features included on both the Blu-ray Disc and DVD are \"Fantasy Comes to Life\", a three-part behind-the-scenes feature including \"Happy Working Song\", \"That's How You Know\" and \"A Blast at the Ball\"; six deleted scenes with brief introductions by director Kevin Lima; bloopers; \"Pip's Predicament: A Pop-Up Adventure\", a short in pop-up storybook style; and Carrie Underwood's music video for \"Ever Ever After\". Featured on the Blu-ray disc only is a trivia game titled \"The D Files\" that runs throughout the movie with high scoring players given access to videos \"So Close\", \"Making Ever Ever After\" and \"True Love's Kiss\". In the United States, certain DVDs at Target stores contain a bonus DVD with a 30-minute-long making-of documentary titled Becoming Enchanted: A New Classic Comes True. This DVD is also sold with certain DVDs at HMV stores in the United Kingdom.\nOn November 12, 2021, the film was added to Disney+ to coincide with Disney+ Day. On October 26, 2022, the film was upgraded to 4K resolution on Disney+.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nEnchanted earned $8 million on the day of its release in the United States, placing at #1. It was also placed at #1 on Thanksgiving Day, earning $6.7 million to bring its two-day total to $14.6 million. The film grossed $14.4 million on the following day, bringing its total haul to $29.0 million placing ahead of other contenders. Enchanted made $34.4 million on the Friday-Sunday period in 3,730 theaters for a per-location average of $9,472 and $49.1 million over the five-day Thanksgiving holiday in 3,730 theaters for a per-location average of $13,153. Its earnings over the five-day holiday exceeded projections by $7 million. Ranking as the second-highest Thanksgiving opening after Toy Story 2, which earned $80.1 million over the five-day holiday in 1999, Enchanted is the first film to open at #1 on the Thanksgiving frame in the 21st century.\nIn its second weekend, Enchanted was also the #1 film, grossing a further $16.4 million at 3,730 locations for a per-theater average of $4,397. It dropped to #2 in its third weekend, with a gross of $10.7 million in 3,520 theaters for a per-theater average of $3,042. It finished its fourth weekend at #4 with a gross of $5.5 million in 3,066 locations for a per-theater average of $1,804. Enchanted earned a gross of $127.8 million in the United States and Canada as well as a total of $340.5 million worldwide. It was the 15th highest-grossing film worldwide released in 2007.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval of 93% based on 193 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A smart re-imagining of fairy tale tropes that's sure to delight children and adults, Enchanted features witty dialogue, sharp animation, and a star turn by Amy Adams.\" Metacritic gave it a rating of 75 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film as the ninth best reviewed film in wide release of 2007 and named it the best family film of 2007. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"A-\" on scale of A to F.\n\nPositive reviews praised the film's take on a classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers as well as the performance of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a \"heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality\" and one that \"has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life\". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as \"the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed to get right until now\" while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, \"More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population \u2013 niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat.\" Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.\nRolling Stone, Premiere, USA Today, and The Boston Globe all gave the film three out of four, while The Baltimore Sun gave the film a B grade. They cited that although the story is relatively predictable, the way in which the predictability of the film is part of the story, the amazingly extravagant musical numbers, along with the way in which Disney pokes fun at its traditional line of animated movies outweighs any squabbles about storyline or being unsure of what age bracket the film is made for. Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun remarked that the film's \"piquant idea and enough good jokes to overcome its uneven movie-making and uncertain tone\", while Claudia Puig of USA Today stated that \"though it's a fairly predictable fish-out-of-water tale (actually a princess-out-of-storybook saga), the casting is so perfect that it takes what could have been a ho-hum idea and renders it magical.\"\nAmy Adams herself garnered many favorable reviews. Reviewers praised her singing ability and asserted that her performance, which was compared by some to her Academy Award-nominated performance in Junebug, has made Adams a movie star, likening it to Mary Poppins' effect on Julie Andrews' career. Similarly, film critics Richard Roeper and Michael Phillips, who gave the film positive reviews on At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper, emphasized the effect of Adams' performance on the film with remarks like \"Amy Adams is this movie\" and \"Amy Adams shows how to make a comic clich\u00e9 work like magic.\" However, both agreed that the final sequence involving the computer-generated dragon \"bogged down\" the film.\nEmpire stated that the film was targeted at children but agreed with other reviewers that the \"extremely game cast\" was the film's best asset. It gave the film three out of five. TIME gave the film a C\u2212, stating that the film \"cannibalizes Walt's vault for jokes\" and \"fails to find a happy ending that doesn't feel two-dimensional\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five and commented that the film \"assumes a beady-eyed and deeply humourless sentimentality\" and that Adams' performance was the \"only decent thing in this overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink-wrap of corporate Disney plastic-ness\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Disney references ==\nAccording to director Kevin Lima, \"thousands\" of references are made to past and future works of Disney in Enchanted, which serve as both a parody of and a \"giant love letter to Disney classics\". It took almost eight years for Walt Disney Studios to greenlight the production of the film because it \"was always quite nervous about the tone in particular\". As Lima worked with Bill Kelly, the writer, to inject Disney references to the plot, it became \"an obsession\"; he derived the name of every character as well as anything that needed a name from past Disney films to bring in more Disney references.\nWhile Disney animators have occasionally inserted a Disney character into background shots \u2013 for example, Donald Duck appears in a crowd in The Little Mermaid \u2013 they have avoided \"mingling characters\" from other Disney films for fear of weakening their individual mythologies. In Enchanted, characters from past Disney films are openly seen, such as the appearances of Thumper and Flower from Bambi in the 2D animation portion of the film. Disney references are also made through camera work, sets, costumes, music and dialogue. Some of the more familiar examples include the use of poisoned apples from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and True Love's Kiss from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Dick Cook, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, admitted that part of the goal of Enchanted was to create a new franchise (through the character of Giselle) and to revive the older ones.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nA sequel, Disenchanted, was released to Disney+ on November 18, 2022. Directed by Adam Shankman, the sequel sees Adams, Dempsey, Menzel, and Marsden reprising their roles. Newcomer Gabriella Baldacchino replaces Covey as Morgan, though Covey has a brief cameo in the film. They are joined by Maya Rudolph, Jayma Mays, and Yvette Nicole Brown as new characters. The film received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nEnchanted at IMDb\nEnchanted at AllMovie\nEnchanted at Box Office Mojo\nEnchanted at Rotten Tomatoes\nEnchanted at Metacritic",

            "For the Love of Benji is a 1977 family film, directed and written by Joe Camp. It is the sequel to the original film, featuring Benji, and the second film in the Benji series, released on  June 10, 1977. It is the first Benji film to star Benjean, Higgins' daughter.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nIn Athens, Greece, a secret agent named Stelios goes to an outdoor caf\u00e9, where the waiter gives him newspapers and a package. The newspapers reveal that a German scientist is missing in Greece, and the package contains a photo of the dog Benji with his family. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Benji\u2019s family arrives at an airport, on their way to the island of Crete in Greece. The children, Paul and Cindy, worry about their dogs, Benji and Tiffany, as they are placed in travel carriers. Cindy tells the airline representative that Tiffany has a \u201ccondition.\u201d While waiting to check in, Mary learns that the man behind her in line, Chandler Dietrich, is also headed to Crete. Dietrich then sneaks into the employee-only luggage area, snatches Benji\u2019s carrier off a conveyor belt, drugs the dog, and imprints a code on his paw. Upon arrival in Crete, Dietrich befriends Mary, while the family learns that Benji and Tiffany missed the connecting flight from Athens. Stelios lurks in the background, watching.\nAt the Athens airport, Benji and Tiffany are in their carriers, stored in a luggage room. When a worker inadvertently lets Benji escape, he and a British couple, Ronald and Elizabeth, chase the dog through the airport and across a runway, but Benji flees into the city. As he wanders the streets of Athens, Benji mistakes another family for his own. After several near collisions with cars, Benji retreats into ancient ruins. There, he sees a stray dog gnawing a bone. The other dog will not share his food, so Benji returns to the city streets. In a marketplace, Benji steals a string of sausages, and returns to the ruins to share them with the stray dog, thus making a new friend.\nThe next day, Benji returns to the marketplace, but the police capture him. Ronald and Elizabeth, claim the dog and take him to their home. Hearing a knock at the door and Ronald takes Benji upstairs as Elizabeth stalls their visitor, Stelios, who poses as a representative of Olympic Airways, and sends Stelios away. Soon, Mary comes to the house in search of Benji, and the dog hears her voice from upstairs. As she leaves, Benji barks at Mary from the window, but a passing truck drowns out the sound. So Benji climbs outside, slides down an awning and chases her taxi. Meanwhile, Dietrich pursues Benji in a sports car, but loses him. Alone again, Benji wanders to a hotel, where he spots Mary, Paul, and Cindy, but runs away when he sees Dietrich. Procuring a Doberman, Dietrich tracks Benji to the ruins. Sometime later, in the city, a butcher feeds Benji in his shop. Benji takes a nap, but is awakened by the Doberman barking. When Dietrich enters the shop, Benji springs from a cupboard and escapes.\nAfter spending the night in the ruins, Benji stakes out his family\u2019s hotel, but he is chased away by the doorman. Returning to the butcher\u2019s shop, Benji sees his friend talking to Stelios, but before Benji can get their attention, Dietrich grabs the dog at gunpoint. However, Stelios and the butcher release the Doberman, whom Dietrich tied up outside the shop, and Stelios follows the Doberman to find Dietrich and Benji. As the Doberman leaps at Dietrich, Benji escapes once more. The Doberman chases Benji to the ruins, but the stray dog chases him away. Benji then returns to the hotel, sneaks inside on a luggage cart, and reunites with his family. However, Stelios arrives to announce that he has to take Benji away for a few days. Before Stelios can explain, Dietrich hits the man over the head with a gun, knocking him out. Dietrich then tells the family that he is a U.S. agent who must take Benji because the dog holds the key to important information. Instructing Mary to call the police and hold Stelios at gunpoint, Dietrich leaves with Benji. Stelios awakens and tells Mary that Dietrich is an impostor. The real Dietrich was found murdered in New Jersey and that this man is impersonating him for his own gain. Stelios explains he is a real secret agent, not Dietrich, and he has orders to save the life of a top scientist and to preserve a project of worldwide significance. Mary is reluctant to believe him, though.\nMeanwhile, the man pretending to be Dietrich takes Benji to a yacht, where Ronald and Elizabeth are waiting. When the couple accuses the impostor of trying to double-cross them, he knocks them unconscious. As Benji escapes, the impostor Dietrich pursues the dog back to the hotel, which is now surrounded by police. Seeing that the impostor is holding Cindy at gunpoint in the car, Benji rushes at the man, knocks the gun to the ground, and rescues Cindy, as the police arrest the impostor.\nSometime later, Paul and Cindy play with Benji on a beach. Stelios explains to Mary that the impostor Dietrich used Benji to smuggle the coordinates for a meeting with a German scientist, who had created a formula for turning one barrel of oil into ten or twelve. The charlatan aimed to steal the formula and sell it to the highest bidder. Benji proudly looks upon a basket of puppies, the result of Tiffany\u2019s \u201ccondition.\u201d\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBenjean as Benji\nPatsy Garrett as Mary\nCynthia Smith as Cindy Chapman\nAllen Fiuzat as Paul Chapman\nTiffany as White Dog\nEd Nelson as Chandler Dietrich\nPeter Bowles as Ronald\nArt Vasil as Stelios\nBridget Armstrong as Elizabeth\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm critic Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times finds the movie to be the adventures of Benji in Athens.

            "Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (also known as Free Willy 2) is a 1995 American family adventure drama film directed by Dwight Little from a screenplay by Karen Janszen, Corey Blechman and John Mattson. It is the sequel to the 1993 film Free Willy and second installment in the Free Willy film series distributed by Warner Bros. under their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label. Jason James Richter, Jayne Atkinson, August Schellenberg, Michael Madsen and Mykelti Williamson reprise their roles from the first film. New cast members include Jon Tenney and Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a. Unlike the previous film where Keiko played Willy, a robotic double created by Edge Innovations was used to play the eponymous whale while the Free Willy Keiko Foundation devised a plan to bring Keiko to the Oregon Coast Aquarium where he would be rehabilitated from poor health. However, Keiko did make an uncredited appearance, reprising his role as Willy through an archival clip shown in the movie. \nSet two years after Jesse freed his orca friend Willy who is now reunited with his family which includes sister Luna, brother Littlespot and mother Catspaw, the plot follows Jesse in a race against time after an oil spill separated Willy and his siblings from their mother and it's up to him to get them back home before the oil traps them in the cove for good.\nFilming commenced in Astoria, Oregon and the San Juan Islands between April and August 1994 with additional filming taking place in California. The film opened on July 19, 1995 to mixed reviews from critics. Despite underperforming at the box office, a third film Free Willy 3: The Rescue was subsequently released in 1997.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIt has been two years since Jesse freed Willy and got him back home to his pod. The Greenwoods are planning a trip to the San Juan Islands to visit Randolph while camping at Camp Nor'Wester. Before they leave, Dwight arrives with news that Jesse's mother was found dead in New York City and left behind another son. This devastates Jesse after many attempts at finding her, but he comes to terms with it, after talking his feelings out with Glen. Jesse's half-brother Elvis is morose, overly talkative and mischievous. He is also prone to telling lies and easily gets on Jesse's nerves. To make matters even worse for Jesse, Elvis is invited along on their trip, so that they can get to know each other. At the environmental institute, Jesse reunites with Randolph, becomes smitten with his goddaughter, Nadine, and is introduced to Willy's family during a day of whale watching. He tracks and reunites with Willy that night.\nAs the Greenwoods continue to enjoy their camping trip, Liberian oil tanker, the Dakar, runs aground on Lawson Reef and spills oil due to an engine malfunction, trapping Willy and his siblings Luna and Littlespot at the campsite. Luna gets oil in her lungs and beaches herself. Jesse and the adults get her back in the water but need further assistance. Benbrook Oil CEO John Milner announces a plan to move the whales into captivity until further notice. Jesse challenges this, making him promise to do whatever he can to get them safely back to their mother Catspaw or else he'll be blamed for Luna's death. Luna's condition worsens the day after Kate Haley treats her. Jesse and Randolph use an old Indian remedy that helps her recover.\nAt a donut shop, Elvis, who ran away yesterday after Jesse, Glen and Annie denied his help which in-turn caused Annie to accidentally break her promise in allowing him to contribute more, overhears John and Wilcox's real plan to sell the whales. With the oil spill reaching dangerous proximity to the cove, Benbrook Oil and the whalers boom it off despite Jesse, Randolph, and Nadine's objections and begin extracting the whales. Elvis rushes back to camp to warn Jesse and Nadine. They confront John, and he and his assistant are knocked into the water for breaking his promise. Willy rescues Littlespot from the extraction. Jesse hijacks the Little Dipper to lead the whales to safety. On Jesse's signal, Willy breaks the boom and leads his siblings away. The Dakar explodes due to fuel vapors igniting after engineers try to start the generator, resulting in the crude oil catching fire.\nRandolph picks up Glen and Annie, who just returned from their unsuccessful search for Elvis until they spotted him on the Little Dipper, and the trio follow the kids' path as Randolph sends a distress call. The whales swim under the flaming oil to safety, but the kids fall into danger when they head into another cove. The fogginess from the smoke causes Jesse to hit a rock, and the Little Dipper begins to sink while the flames seal off the cove. A search and rescue helicopter locates them, pulling Elvis and Nadine to safety. However, Jesse slips out of the harness, only inches away from the helicopter, and due to smoke choking the engine, it is forced to leave him behind. Jesse nearly drowns, but Willy returns for his friend and carries him safely under the fire in time for the adults to retrieve Jesse. Though Jesse is curious as to why Willy hasn't left, Randolph reveals the signal must be performed. Jesse does it and he, Glen, and Annie say goodbye to Willy.\nShortly after the Coastal Marine Patrol deliver Elvis and Nadine, Elvis gives Jesse an old picture of him and their mother which was taped back together after it had \u201ca little accident\u201d according to Elvis. He tearfully tells Jesse that their mother talked about him all the time and felt bad about abandoning him. Jesse thanks him and hugs him, finally accepting Elvis as his brother and able to make peace with what happened with his mom. Glen approves Annie's proposal of adopting Elvis. Elvis asks where the whales are, and Jesse says that they\u2019ve made it back to their mom. When Elvis asks how he knows, Jesse clutches his necklace Randolph gave him earlier and says, \u201cI know.\u201d He then recites the old prayer Randolph taught him in the previous movie as the next scene shows Willy, Luna and Littlespot reunited with Catspaw and their pod.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJason James Richter as Jesse\nFrancis Capra as Elvis\nMary Kate Schellhardt as Nadine\nAugust Schellenberg as Randolph Johnson\nMichael Madsen as Glen Greenwood\nJayne Atkinson as Annie Greenwood\nMykelti Williamson as Dwight Mercer\nElizabeth Pe\u00f1a as Dr. Kate Haley\nJon Tenney as John Milner\nPaul Tuerpe as Milner's assistant\nM.

Jason James Richter returned to reprise his role as Jesse after renegotiating the original sequel option from the first film from $150,000 to $1.5 million with an option for a third sequel.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFree Willy 2 grossed $30 million in the United States and Canada and $68 million worldwide on a $31 million budget. \nThe film received mixed reviews from critics, though many were impressed with the film's subtle approach to pollution and other environmental issues, while focusing on family values. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 50% of 26 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Good-natured yet utterly unsurprising, Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home will strike all but the youngest of viewers as a poorly orca-strated sequel.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\nFree Willy 2 was nominated for Worst Sequel and The Sequel Nobody Was Clamoring For at the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, but lost to Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls and Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, respectively. Willy won Favorite Animal Star at the 1996 Kids' Choice Awards.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nReleased through MJJ Music in association with 550 Music and Epic Soundtrax in 1995, the soundtrack contained most of the songs from the film plus two additional tracks from Brownstone, whose song \"Sometimes Dancin'\" first appeared on their debut album From the Bottom Up, and 3T who previously recorded \"Didn't Mean to Hurt You\" for the previous film. \"My Spirit Calls Out\", the K 'aw Daa Gangaas penned Haida song Randolph sings when he heals Luna, is the lone song not included on the soundtrack.\nBasil Poledouris returned to compose new music and also incorporated several scoring elements from the previous film.\nMichael Jackson continued his affiliation with the Free Willy franchise when \"Childhood\", originally released from his greatest hits/ninth album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I as a double A-side with that album's lead single \"Scream\", served as the main theme around Elvis. The instrumental version is featured when he looks at a photo of the Greenwoods with Jesse while spending the night alone.\nAn instrumental version of Nathan Cavaleri's song \"Lou's Blues\" was used to dub Jesse's offscreen guitar playing.\nAdditionally, two renditions of Bob Dylan's \"Forever Young\" are also featured in the film. One from Jackson's sister Rebbie can be heard inside the donut shop Elvis and Wilcox attend, while the end credits (which featured orca footage background shots by Bob Talbot) used the previously recorded version by The Pretenders from the film With Honors and the band's album Last of the Independents.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n== Title ==\nOn early UK home video promotions, the film was titled simply \"Willy 2: The Adventure Home\", presumably because the film's premise, unlike its predecessor's, does not involve Willy being freed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFree Willy 2: The Adventure Home at IMDb",

The film stars Devin Neil Oatway, Johna Stewart and Stephen Macht. The film's script is loosely based on Shin Sang-ok's 1985 film Pulgasari, which he had directed while being held in North Korea and which was itself a remake of a lost 1962 film. The film was produced through Shin's production company Sheen Communications.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the medieval kingdom of Donnegold, a young prince named Davin (Devin Oatway) lives with his father, the noble King Henryk (Sean McNamara). This comes to an end when the King's black knight, El El (Stephen Macht), poisons him. As he lays dying, Henryk gives his son a small black statue of a creature. He tells him that it is called \"Galgameth\", the family guardian of legend. Davin takes it and while he is away mourning his father, El El secretly shatters the statue and takes command, thrusting the kingdom into turmoil under Davin's name. Davin is given the broken statue by a maidservant and cries. The next morning he finds that the statue has become a living creature which he nicknames \"Galgy\" (Felix Silla and Doug Jones). Brought to life by the prince's tears, Galgameth becomes his friend and guardian as he finds himself chased by El El and in the company of disgruntled peasants who are planning a revolt in order to dethrone the man they think is the source of all their trouble, Prince Davin.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDevin Oatway as Prince Davin\nSean McNamara as King Henryk\nStephen Macht as El El\nLou Wagner as Zethar\nTime Winters as Templeton\nJames Nixon as Bertrand\nFelix Silla as Little Galgy\nDoug Jones as Big Galgy\nBrendan O'Brien as Heretic\nTom Dugan as William\nRichard Steven Horvitz as Kinch\nElizabeth Cheap as Periel\nPatrick Richwood as Grecy\nKen Thorley as Footy\nJohna Stewart-Bowden as Julia\nCorneliu \u021aigancu as Zhidao\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe production was filmed on locations in Romania, including Bucharest and Z\u0103rne\u0219ti.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nOriginal release was in Spain on November 18, 1996, followed by release in Japan on November 21.

            "Golden Book Video was a line of children/family animated and live-action videos marketed by Western Publishing, which began during the holiday season of 1985. They featured characters and stories from Western's print publications, such as Little Golden Books, and were originally released on VHS video cassette for under $10.\nThe videos made use of limited animation techniques to add motion to original illustrations from Western's print books; Western called this approach \"bringing storybooks to life\". As production was carried-out by multiple companies (usually Studio Consultants Inc., Universal Recording Corp. and Animagination Inc., among others), contents of the videos varied. Typically, they featured a full voice cast, with background music sourced from production music libraries (the APM Music library, in most cases), although original songs were recorded for some videos, occasionally with sing-along lyrics appearing on-screen. The video adaptions often carried original material that was not present in the original books. Some of their video releases were mastered with Dolby Stereo.\nStarting in 1986, Golden also began releasing Golden Book Music Videos, which usually contained similar limited animation set to new illustrations and a full-length story, incorporating a combination of classic children's songs and new original songs. Golden Book Video also started the Golden Step-Ahead Video series, featuring educational videos dealing with subjects such as simple reading/letter phonics, basic mathematics, what going to school is like, etc.\nIn 1987, Golden Book Video started straying away from book adaptations and began releasing general entertainment (i.e. cartoon episodes, TV specials, etc.) under their then-new \"Golden Vision\" banner, along with some newly created content (usually live-action). By 1990, the Golden Vision banner was dropped and all new products, including general entertainment productions, were released under the regular Golden Book Video branding.\nAlso, starting in 1989, many of the earlier \"storybook adaptation\" videos were reissued under the \"Golden Book Video Classics\" banner, which often would have the same famous golden spine on the sides of the box similar to Little Golden Books. Beginning in 1991, Golden Book Video also began releasing several older CBS after-school special cartoons produced by Bosustow Entertainment under this banner.\nIn 1991, Golden Book Video purchased and absorbed Hi-Tops Video from Heron Communications, and began releasing new titles formerly distributed by Hi-Tops, such as the Baby Songs series and the Madeline specials.\nBy 1996, Golden Book Video was absorbed into its parent company's Golden Books Family Entertainment division, and from 1998, Sony Wonder then distributed VHS and DVD tapes of Western Publishing properties.\nRandom House and Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics) bought out Golden Books Family Entertainment in 2001.\n\n\n== VHS Releases ==\n\n\n=== Main series ===\n3 Favorite Golden Stories (1985)\n3 Best-Loved Golden Stories (1985)\n3 Richard Scarry Animal Nursery Tales (1985)\n3 Golden Amye Rosenberg Stories (1985)\n3 Mercer Mayer Stories (1985)\n3 Golden Jungle Animal Tales (1985)\n3 Hugga Bunch Stories (1985)\n3 Masters of the Universe Stories (1985)\n3 She-Ra: Princess of Power Stories (1985)\n3 Sesame Street Stories (1985)\n4 Masters of the Universe Stories (1985)\n5 Sesame Street Stories (1985)\n3 Fairy Tale Classics (1986)\n3 Golden Bible Stories (1986)\n3 Tales From the Care Bears (1986)\n3 Golden Richard Scarry Tales (1986)\nLearn About Living Stories (1986)\nPound Puppies Adventures (1986)\nMerry Mother Goose (1986)\n3 Hans Christian Andersen Stories (1986)\nPound Puppies Stories (1986)\n3 My Pet Monster Tales (1986)\n3 Favorite Fairy Tales (1986)\nPound Puppies Tales (1987)\n\n\n=== Golden Book Music Video ===\nSing, Giggle, and Grin (1986)\nSee, Sing, and Play (1986)\nA Child's First Nursery Songs (1986)\nSing, Stretch, & Shape Up (1987)\nSongs from Mother Goose (1987)\n\n\n=== Golden Step-Ahead Video ===\nGet Ready to Read (1986)\nGet Ready for School (1986)\nKnow the Alphabet (1986)\nGet Ready for Math (1986)\nThe Rainy Day Numbers Show (1987)\nJourney Through the Jungle of Words (1987)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Official \"Little Golden Books\" Page",

Similarly, Eric Kohn of IndieWire praised the documentary, describing it as \"a visionary case for veganism in black and white.\" Guy Lodge of Variety says the film's \"radiantly beautiful imagery and gently immersive storytelling aren\u2019t in service of a single browbeating message, but a broader, holistic view of where we and the animals we rear, use and consume fit into a single circle of life.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGunda at IMDb",
            "Hawmps! is a 1976 American Western slapstick comedy film about a United States Cavalry experiment to introduce camels into the service in the western United States, specifically Texas. The cast included James Hampton, Christopher Connelly and Slim Pickens.\nIt was written by William Bickley, Joe Camp, and Michael Warren, directed by Joe Camp, and produced by Mulberry Square Productions.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nHoward Clemmons tells his grandchildren about his adventures as a young U.S. Cavalry Lieutenant in 1854. Clemmons had no seniority, power or talent for the army and was therefore chosen to lead an experimental project using camels as cavalry mounts in the southwest U.S. Clemmons remembers arriving at Fort Val Verde, Texas, where Sgt. Uriah Tibbs is expecting Arabian horses. When Tibbs explains that he and his men competed for the privilege of being in the project, Clemmons declines to tell him the \u201cArabians\u201d are actually camels. Clemmons then reports to the fort's commander, Col. Seymour Hawkins, who is more interested in his cannon practice than Clemmons's camel project. Later, Clemmons inspects the troops, including Nathaniel R. Higgins, who informs Clemmons that he re-enlisted so he could ride an Arabian horse. Although Clemmons wants to tell the men the truth, he is interrupted when a cook throws dishwater out the door and soaks him. When Clemmons and Tibbs later discuss the project at the saloon, they are accosted by Sgt. Naman Tucker, who is outraged his troopers did not receive the Arabian horses. A drunken Clemmons slides under the table as the two sergeants fight.\nThe next day, the camels arrive, but the troops ride their horses back to the fort in disgust, leaving Clemmons to deal with the camels. Hi Jolly, an Arab camel trainer, reports to Clemmons and as they herd camels through town, horses stampede in fright, ladies scream and dogs bark in fear. A wagon overturns, and a barrel splits open covering Col. Hawkins's daughter, Jennifer, in molasses. Hawkins berates Clemmons for the damage and plans to cancel the project, but Clemmons declares that the orders came from Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War. That night, Jennifer sneaks into Clemmons's room, pours a small crock of molasses over his head, and declares them even before inviting him to afternoon tea. The next day, Hi Jolly gives his first lesson in camel care as Tucker rides up and insults Tibbs's men. Clemmons warns Tucker that if he insults the camel corps again, Clemmons will put him on report and transfer him into the camel project. To the cheers of Tibbs's men, Tucker apologizes and rides away. As Hi Jolly congratulates his comrade on raising the men's morale, Clemmons faints. Over time, the soldiers continue their camel training, but the lessons do not go well. When the men finally learn to mount the camels, the animals run wild, dumping them in the dirt and water troughs. That night, the men bet Tucker he cannot lasso a camel. When Tucker lands the rope around the camel's neck, the beast runs in panic, dragging Tucker behind. The next morning, the camel returns, still dragging Tucker, bleeding and bruised.\nAs weeks pass, the men become proficient with their camels and Clemmons romances Jennifer. He is ordered to capture a Native American renegade and Clemmons and his men pursue the outlaws, but they are thrown off their camels at a river. Later, Hi Jolly explains that camels are afraid of water; if Clemmons had dismounted and demonstrated the water was shallow, the camels would have crossed. That night, Jennifer takes a stroll with Clemmons, who tells her Col. Hawkins is cancelling the camel project. When Clemmons whines that he is a failure, Jennifer scolds him for being too cowardly to fight for his career.\nThe next morning, Clemmons proposes a 300-mile race to the town of Dos Rios between his camels and Tucker's horses. When Hawkins declines, Clemmons deceitfully claims that the camel experiment is the President's pet project. Sometime later, Hi Jolly is injured in a barroom brawl and cannot ride. Before the race, Jennifer gives Clemmons a thick book on camels and kisses him. Col. Hawkins fires a cannon and the race is on. Tucker's horses outpace Clemmons's camels, but within a few days, Clemmons's men catch up. However, Clemmons learns from Corporal Leroy that Tucker and his men are captured by an outlaw named Bad Jack Cutter at Dagger's Point. Clemmons insists on rescuing Tucker and his men. Along the way, Clemmons and Tibbs capture two other outlaws, steal their clothes and horses, then ride into town in disguise to meet Bad Jack, agreeing to join his gang. Later, they find Tucker and his men in jail and try to pull out the window bars using a horse. When the horse fails, a camel demolishes the entire jail. Tucker and his men run, leaving Tibbs and Clemmons to face the outlaws alone. A gunfight ensues but Clemmons's men ride in on camelback, rescuing their leaders, and ride off before the outlaws can get to their horses. That night, Clemmons discovers they have lost the camel carrying all but one of their water barrels. Although Clemmons believes they can find water in the mountains, Tibbs insists they follow the map to the next waterhole. After two days of riding, they discover the hole is dry, and they are out of water. Tibbs wants to ride back to a river, but Clemmons convinces Tibbs to let him try to reach the mountains, ordering Tibbs to head to the river if he does not return by sunset. Clemmons finds water, but as he ties the barrel onto his camel, a shot rings out. Black Jack exchanges gunfire with Clemmons as the camel runs away. After sundown, the camel reaches Tibbs and his men. The men drink their fill, then realize Clemmons is missing. The next morning, Black Jack realizes Clemmons is out of ammunition. He climbs down the rocks and shoots Clemmons in the chest but as he celebrates, Tibbs and the men capture him. Much to Tibbs's surprise, Clemmons is saved by the book Jennifer gave him; it was inside his jacket and stopped Bad Jack's bullet.\nLater, Clemmons's troop races past Tucker and his men's exhausted horses outside Dos Rios. As Clemmons celebrates his victory, a telegram arrives from Washington, D.C., reporting that Congress has approved construction of the transcontinental railroad and the camel project is therefore unnecessary. Clemmons is ordered to turn the camels loose, but Tibbs and the men protest, concerned that the camels will perish in the American desert. As Clemmons finishes telling the story to his grandchildren, his wife, Jennifer, announces that dinner is ready. Clemmons goes outside to ring the dinner triangle, but Hi Jolly, Higgins and Tibbs report that one of the camels is in labor. As the four old men walk to the barn, Higgins wonders if they could move the camels closer to the house because he is tired that \"each day he must walk a mile for a camel\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCamel cavalry\nHi Jolly\nU.S. Camel Corps\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHawmps! at IMDb\nHawmps! at the TCM Movie Database",
            "Herbie Rides Again is a 1974 American comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson from a screenplay by Bill Walsh, based on a story by Gordon Buford. The film is the second installment in the Herbie film series and the sequel to The Love Bug (1968). It stars Helen Hayes, Stefanie Powers, Ken Berry, and Keenan Wynn reprising his villainous role as Alonzo Hawk (originated in the films The Absent-Minded Professor and Son of Flubber).\nHerbie Rides Again was followed by Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nNotorious real estate magnate and demolition baron Alonzo A. Hawk (Keenan Wynn) is ready to build his newest office building, the 130-story Hawk Plaza in San Francisco. His only obstacle is the 1892 firehouse which is the only building on the site still standing and is inhabited by Mrs. Steinmetz (Helen Hayes), widow of its former owner, Fire Captain Steinmetz, and aunt of mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz. Hawk's numerous attempts at evicting Mrs. Steinmetz have been unsuccessful, while the construction workers are growing impatient with Hawk's alleged indecision, reminding him that the whole thing is costing him $80,000 a day. Therefore, when Hawk's lawyer nephew Willoughby Whitfield (Ken Berry) comes to visit him, Hawk sends him to Mrs. Steinmetz.\nMrs. Steinmetz takes a liking to Willoughby due to his youthful looks and good manners, in contrast to Hawk's henchmen. She introduces him to Herbie the Love Bug, who is staying with her while his owner Jim Douglas is racing in Europe and Tennessee is in Tibet, as well as two other sentient machines: an early 20th-century orchestrion that plays on its own; and Old No. 22, a retired cable car. Her neighbor Nicole (Stefanie Powers), who was taken in by Mrs. Steinmetz after her apartment was demolished by Hawk, punches Willoughby in the face due to him working for Hawk, but tries to make it up to him by offering him a ride in Herbie. Herbie goes berserk after Willoughby insults him twice, eventually taking the two to a car version of a joust tournament, which Herbie wins.\nLater at a restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf, Nicole shocks Willboughy by telling him all the horrible things Hawk has done, including building a parking garage on the very same lot where Joe DiMaggio and his brothers learned to play baseball. Willoughby is upset about this and accidentally reveals that Hawk is his uncle; an enraged Nicole hits him with a boiled lobster in response, sending him splashing into the water below. He decides to sever all ties with Hawk and initially tries to go home in disguise, but is convinced by a remorseful Nicole to stay after she hears him criticize his uncle while talking to his mother on the telephone.\nMeanwhile, Hawk decides to take it upon himself to drive Mrs. Steinmetz out, starting with stealing Herbie. Hawk is initially successful with his hotwiring skill, but also insults Herbie, who retaliates by causing a series of traffic collisions, and discards Hawk at his own office door. Later, while Herbie takes Mrs. Steinmetz to market, they are chased by Hawk's men; Herbie makes several daring escapes, culminating in traveling through the 1909 landmark Sheraton Palace Hotel and along a suspension cable on the Golden Gate Bridge, with Mrs. Steinmetz oblivious throughout.\nMrs. Steinmetz asks Nicole and Willoughby to pick up some more groceries for her, then suggests to Herbie that he drive them to the beach. Willoughby and Nicole enjoy a romantic moment at the beach and begin to fall in love, but Hawk's chauffeur, spying on Herbie and the duo, bribes a man to park his trailer on the only road out, prompting Herbie to surf through the coastal bay to find an alternate route.\nWhen they return to the firehouse after dark, every item of furniture has been removed by Hawk. Mrs. Steinmetz, Willoughby, Nicole, and Herbie track the theft to Hawk's warehouse, where they break in and recover Mrs. Steinmetz's belongings, loaded into Old No. 22. Hawk's security guards catch them in the act, but Herbie traps them by pushing other items off the warehouse shelves. On the way home, Herbie and Old No. 22 are pursued by Hawk, and Mrs. Steinmetz meets and becomes enamored with an inebriated old-timer named Judson, who resembles her late husband, Captain Steinmetz.\nThe next morning, Mrs. Steinmetz decides to confront Hawk herself. Accompanied by Willoughby, in spite of Nicole telling him not to let her, Mrs. Steinmetz drives Herbie onto the window-cleaning machine of Hawk\u2019s skyscraper to reach his office, where they overhear Hawk on the phone with Loostgarten (Chuck McCann), an independent demolition agent, about a deal to demolish the firehouse. In response, she activates the window cleaning machine to fill the office with soap and water. Herbie drives in and chases Hawk around the office, then outside onto a ledge of the building, until Mrs Steinmetz calms him down.\nDisguising his voice to resemble his uncle's, Willoughby calls Loostgarten and misdirects him to demolish Hawk's own house. Late that evening, Loostgarten telephones Hawk to confirm the demolition, waking Hawk from a nightmare of being at Herbie's mercy; Hawk gives confirmation, but realizes too late that he has condemned his own residence, and angrily chases after Loostgarten after a portion of his house is demolished.\nHawk fakes a truce with Mrs. Steinmetz; thinking him to be sincere, Willoughby and Nicole go for dinner, while Mrs. Steinmetz invites Judson to the firehouse for a date of their own. Hawk shows up with bulldozers and frontloaders to crush the firehouse and its inhabitants once and for all, prompting Herbie to go in search of Nicole and Willoughby. In the absence of Herbie, the only means of defense is an antique fire hose, which Judson uses against Hawk's men until it bursts.\nFinding Nicole and Willoughby, Herbie rounds up an army of other sentient Volkswagen Beetles from around the city (including a wrecked one from a junkyard), and they chase after Hawk and his men, taking advantage of Hawk's irrational fear of Herbie and causing his men to flee. Hawk, after nearly getting knocked down by a police car, is arrested after telling his bizarre tale of an army of Volkswagen Beetles chasing him. Nicole and Willoughby get married, and ride Herbie through an arch formed by his Volkswagen Beetle friends.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production notes ==\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nFritz Feld, who appears as the Maitre d', and Vito Scotti, who plays the Italian cab driver, also appear in the sequel Herbie Goes Bananas as crewmen of the ship Sun Princess. Dan Tobin, Raymond Bailey, Iggie Wolfington, Robert S. Carson, and John Zaremba played some of Hawk's attorneys; Disney regular Norman Grabowski played \"Security guard #2;\" John Myhers played the San Francisco's Office of the President announcer; and Alan Carney played a judge at the Chicken Tournament.\nWhile Keenan Wynn appears to be reprising his role of Alonzo Hawk from the Flubber movies, this may not technically be the case. He is called Alonzo P. Hawk in both Flubbers and Alonzo A. Hawk in Herbie, making it unclear whether the two series share a universe, or if the two Alonzo Hawks are related to each other.\n\n\n=== Deleted scenes ===\nThe GAF View-Master reel set for the film shows a still from a deleted sequence where one of Hawk's nightmares has him about to be treated by a pair of white VW Beetle doctors, who decide to \"take his carburetor out and have a look at it\".  As they approach Hawk, he is awakened by Loostgarten.\n\n\n=== Vehicles ===\nThe Herbies used for the film consisted both of 1963 and 1965 Beetles.\nThe included 1965 models make for some continuity errors as the windows are larger on the 1965 cars.\nOne of the VW Beetles used in the deleted nightmare sequence (see above) was first used in The Love Bug as a stunt car during the El Dorado race (also used for interior filming). Many years after Herbie Rides Again, the car's red cross, mechanical arms, and eyeball headlights were removed and restored to their former appearance.\nIt is the first of the Herbie series in which Herbie is actually described as a \"Volkswagen\" - in the previous instalment The Love Bug- the producers were explicitly forbidden from mentioning the Volkswagen name anywhere in the film (although the logo was prominently seen).  After it had been demonstrated the success of the film had probably helped, rather than hindered Beetle sales (its peak year for sales was 1971, three years after The Love Bug', the automaker lifted many of the restrictions on Walt Disney for subsequent films).  By the time of Herbie Rides Again in 1974, the Beetle was being replaced by the Golf/Rabbit model in most markets around the world, and Beetle sales were declining, thus the films were instead seen as a promotion and marketing tool for the car.\n\n\n=== \"World's Highest Building\" ===\n\"Hawk Plaza\" is shown as a shining, twin-tower 130-story San Francisco skyscraper touted as \"The World's Highest Building\". Coincidentally, The Towering Inferno, released six months later, featured \"The Glass Tower,\" a shining, single-tower 138-story San Francisco skyscraper touted as \"The Tallest Building in the World.\" In actuality, New York's twin towers of the World Trade Center, \"The Tallest Buildings in the World\" had officially opened in 1973, and Chicago's 108-story Sears Tower claimed that title in May 1974, just one month before Herbie Rides Again was released.\n\n\n== Release ==\nHerbie Rides Again had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on February 11, 1974. It opened the following day to the public in London at the Dominion Theatre. It opened on June 6, 1974 in the United States.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film grossed $38,229,000 at the United States and Canada box office, generating Disney $17,500,000 in theatrical rentals. The film earned rentals of around $13,300,000 overseas, giving worldwide rentals of almost $31 million.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nHerbie Rides Again was first released on VHS on March 27, 1982.\nHerbie Rides Again was first released on DVD in Region 1 on May 4, 2004, and was re-released as a 2-DVD double feature set along with Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo on April 26, 2009. On September 2, 2012, Herbie Rides Again was re-released on DVD as part of Herbie: 4-Movie Collection along with The Love Bug, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on December 16, 2014, as a Disney Movie Club exclusive title.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nVincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"There's nothing harmful about 'Herbie Rides Again'; it's simply not very good.\" Variety reported, \"It should prove gleeful enough for the kiddies, and at the short and sweet unspooling time of 88 minutes, painless pleasantry for adult chaperones as well.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \"suffers from the slackening of freshness and invention which so often bedevils sequels ... Still, 'Herbie Rides Again' preserves the bright, unreal feeling of that special Disney world which more and more is a world to itself.\" Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"a surprisingly tolerable sequel.\"\nHerbie Rides Again presently holds a score of 80% at Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out to 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of American films of 1974\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nHerbie Rides Again at IMDb\nHerbie Rides Again at the TCM Movie Database\nHerbie Rides Again at AllMovie",

Fox). It also features the voice work of Sinbad, Carla Gugino, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Stephen Tobolowsky, Jon Polito, Adam Goldberg, Al Michaels, Tommy Lasorda and Bob Uecker.

The film was released on March 8, 1996, and went on to gross over $32 million at the box office.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Burnford-Seaver family, owners of Shadow the Golden Retriever, Sassy the Himalayan cat, and Chance the American Bulldog, take a family vacation to Canada; and decide to bring their animals with them. At the San Francisco International Airport, the animals escape after Chance panics while mistaking airport workers for the workers at the pound, after his earlier actions angered Jamie causing Chance to believe that Jamie was sending him back to the pound. In a frenzy, Chance breaks free from his carrier. Shadow and Sassy follow his lead, and together after eluding airport authorities, the animals find themselves in the city of San Francisco. With home on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge, the trio set out to once again find their way back.\nAs their journey begins, Chance unintentionally runs into a Boxer and his Bullmastiff friend; named Ashcan and Pete, respectively. Territorial of their terrain, Ashcan refuses to let them pass. As Shadow attempts to explain to them that they are only seeking to find their way home, Ashcan and Pete threaten that they are going to eat Sassy. Shadow begins to fight Ashcan, while Sassy hides safely high upon a nearby window sill. A group of streetwise stray animals known as Riley's Gang, join the confrontation and help overpower Ashcan and Pete. The group explains to the trio that the city is not a safe place for domesticated pets. In the scuffle, Chance had run for safety. Riley sends a member of the gang named Delilah to find him, where she explains that they mean no harm.\nShadow and Sassy make their way through downtown with the rest of Riley's Gang. When a vehicle known as the \"Blood Red Van\" appears, Riley instructs that they all take cover and explains that the car takes stray dogs off the streets to a place called \"the Lab\". He further explains that he avoids cars, due to their relation to humans, and he does not trust humans at all. Acknowledging their differences regarding humans, Shadow and Sassy express their thanks to the group and continue to make their way towards the Golden Gate Bridge. While Chance and Delilah make their way through the city, Chance asks about Riley's distrust of humans. She explains that Riley was abandoned by his owners when he was a puppy. Having to adapt to survive as a stray, he created his gang to protect all stray animals from humans. When they make their way through the park, Chance begins to be romantically interested in Delilah.\nAs Shadow and Sassy continue through the city, Ashcan and Pete continue following them. When the pair come upon a housefire and upon hearing the discussion of frantic parents and the San Francisco Fire Department Battalion Chief, they realize that a young boy and his kitten are still inside the house. Shadow rushes into the home through the basement window to rescue the boy, while Sassy follows after him in search of the kitten. Shadow exits moments later with the boy by his side, as the porch collapses following a sudden backdraft of flames. Sassy joins the rest with the kitten, thereafter. Upon witnessing their heroics, Riley and his gang praise their actions and resolve to help them find Chance before returning to the gang's hideout. Upon arriving, they discover that Chance and Delilah are already there.

He is captured and abducted by its drivers, who intend to take him back to \"the lab\". As the vehicle drives off, all of the animals work together to stop the car and free Chance as well as the other dogs in its cages. As the drivers try to avoid the attacking animals, a member of the gang named Bando enters the van, puts it in reverse, and backs it into the river. Reunited, the animals celebrate their victory. Delilah begins to explain to Chance that they may be too different for each other after all, only for him to run away from the group in frustration. Riley agrees to accompany and help Shadow and Sassy reach the Golden Gate Bridge. Just before crossing the bridge, the pair are once again ambushed by Ashcan and Pete. Chance joins the fight, scaring off the attackers. Together again, the trio cross the Golden Gate Bridge and find their owners.\nThe family returns home with their three pets: Chance, Shadow, and Sassy; though Chance is still saddened about his perceived loss of Delilah.

            "In Search of the Castaways (also known as The Castaways) is a 1962 American adventure film starring Maurice Chevalier and Hayley Mills in a tale about a worldwide search for a shipwrecked sea captain. The film was produced by Walt Disney Productions and directed by Robert Stevenson from a screenplay by Lowell S. Hawley, based upon Jules Verne's 1868 adventure novel Captain Grant's Children.\nIn Search of the Castaways was the third of six films Hayley Mills starred in at Disney.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Britain in 1858, Professor Paganel, a scientifically thinking French geography professor, finds a bottle containing a note which he believes to have been written by the missing Captain John Grant. Paganel and Grant's two teenaged children, Mary and Robert, approach John Glenarvan and his father, the wealthy shipping magnate Lord Glenarvan, the owner of Captain Grant's ship, and persuade them to finance a search expedition. The expedition sets sail and ventures halfway around the world to South America.\nIn the Andes, an earthquake sends them down a mountain on a glacier. A giant condor snatches up Robert but Thalcave, an Indian chief, rescues him. He later claims to know the whereabouts of Captain Grant. After surviving a tidal wave and a lightning storm, the group discovers that the well-meaning Thalcave was mistaken. Meanwhile, a budding romance develops between young Mary Grant and Lord Glenarvan's son John.\nThey then depart for Australia, where Paganel feels sure they will find Captain Grant. In Melbourne they meet a treacherous gunrunner, Thomas Ayerton, who produces evidence that Captain Grant is in New Zealand. Unaware that Ayerton is the third mate who caused a mutiny on Grant's ship, the search party once more sets sail. Ayerton causes another mutiny and sets the group adrift. They are captured by Maori cannibals, and are imprisoned along with Captain Grant's shipmate, Bill Gaye, who helps them escape to a volcano. They evade their pursuers by starting an avalanche which triggers an eruption.\nThey finally find Captain Grant, overcome Ayerton and his mutineers, and sail for home. As they all sit around talking, the note that Professor Paganel initially found (and that was supposedly in Captain Grant's handwriting) is brought up. Captain Grant states that he never wrote any note, to which Bill says: \"The voice be the voice of a God-fearing man. But the hands are the hands of a forger\", implying that he imitated Captain Grant's handwriting and wrote the note himself. In the final scene, the Professor points out John and Mary stargazing out at the railing, clearly falling for one another.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nMaurice Chevalier as Jacques Paganel\nHayley Mills as Mary Grant\nGeorge Sanders as Thomas Ayerton\nWilfrid Hyde-White as Lord Glenarvan\nMichael Anderson Jr. as John Glenarvan\nKeith Hamshere as Robert Grant\nAntonio Cifariello as Thalcave, the Indian Chief\nWilfrid Brambell as Bill Gaye\nJack Gwillim as Captain Grant\nInia Te Wiata as Maori Chief\nRonald Fraser as guard at dockyard gate\nNorman Bird as senior yacht guard\nGeorge Murcell as Ayerton's assistant\nMark Dignam as rich man at yacht party\nMichael Wynne as crooked sailor\nDavid Spenser as South American guide\nMilo Sperber as crooked sailor\nRoger Delgado as Patagonian prisoner\nBarry Keegan as Irish claimant\nMaxwell Shaw as sailor\nAndreas Malandrinos as crooked sailor\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally called The Castaways. It was devised by Disney specifically as a vehicle for Hayley Mills, who was under contract to the studio to make a film a year for five years. Disney wanted to age her gradually on screen and she would have her first case of \"puppy love\" in the film. Disney wanted Mills' brother Jonathan to play her brother on screen but his school teachers turned it down.\nIn April 1961, Disney announced they would make the film with Mills and Charles Laughton with Hugh Attool to produce and Robert Stevenson to direct. Maurice Chevalier then came on board with production to begin in June. The role of Mills' brother went to Keith Hamshere, who played the lead in Oliver! on stage.\nLaughton ended up dropping out of the film. In January 1962, he was diagnosed with the cancer which caused his death in December.\nPrincipal photography was at Pinewood Studios in England. Disney said this was done because Mills' contract \"calls for alternating her pictures here and there each year\".\n\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nSongs composed by the Sherman Brothers include \"Castaway\", \"Merci Beaucoup\", \"Let's Climb (Grimpons)\" and \"Enjoy It\", with an orchestral arrangement of \"Castaway\" serving as the film's overture.\nMaurice Chevalier later sang the Sherman Brothers' theme song \"The Aristocats\" from Disney's 1970 animated film The Aristocats.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nIn Search of the Castaways was a commercial success. Upon its initial release, it earned $4.9 million in North American theatrical rentals. It was one of the 12 most popular movies at the British box office in 1963.\n\n\n=== Critical ===\nThe New York Times declared: \"It is, as we say, a whopping fable, more gimmicky than imaginative, but it doesn't lack for lively melodrama that is more innocent and wholesome than much of the stuff the children see these days on television\".\nA review in Variety said: \"Walt Disney has come up with another splendid piece of spectacular hokum, lavishly coloured and packed with incident and special effects. It can hardly fail to appeal to all types of audience, though apparently aimed mainly at the moppets\".\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Well timed for Christmas, this film is designed to keep the family wide awake after the plum-pudding, when the critical faculties are not too sharp. Attention is discreetly drawn away from the rather cardboard characters, and the Fauntleroy smile of Michael Anderson, by a kaleidoscope of colour and movement\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1962\nList of films set in New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nIn Search of the Castaways at IMDb\nIn Search of the Castaways at the TCM Movie Database\nIn Search of the Castaways at AllMovie",
            "The Incredible Journey film series (also referred to as the Homeward Bound series), consists of American adventure family-comedy films, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Sheila Burnford. The plot centers around unlikely trios of pets, who must work together as teams to find their way back through hundreds of miles to their respective homes. Each film uses a combination of voice acting with animal actors to portray for triple leads and emote their thoughts and spirit, alongside the actors for their family of owners.\nThe franchise includes the 1963 critically esteemed original feature film adaptation of the novel, as well as the 1993 remake and its respective 1996 sequel. The remake was similarly a box office success and met with positive reception with critics, and its sequel was met with mixed reviews.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nThe 1961 British adventure children's novel by Scottish author Sheila Burnford, served as the inspiration for The Walt Disney Company's Homeward Bound film series. The story follows three pets: a young Labrador Retriever named Luath, an old English Bull Terrier named Champion Boroughcastle Brigadier of Doune (nicknamed \"Bodger\" for short), and a loyal Siamese cat name Tao. Together the animals brave over 300 miles through the Northwestern Ontario Canadian wilderness, searching for their masters. The events along the way portray the stress and suffering they experience along the way, as well as the loyalty and love the animals have for their owners.\nBurnford has stated that though the novel is associated with children's literature, she did not write it with this intention. The author was inspired to write the story, based on the three family pets that she and her husband had while living in Canada, which each had a remarkably close relationship with each other. Following The Walt Disney Company 1963 adaptation, the studio developed a film franchise, with a reboot and its sequel.\n\n\n== Films ==\n\n\n=== The Incredible Journey (1963) ===\n\nProfessor James Hunter is the proud owner of an aging English Bull Terrior named Bodger.

            "It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie is a 2002 American musical fantasy comedy television film directed by Kirk R. Thatcher and written by Tom Martin and Jim Lewis. The film premiered November 29, 2002 on NBC and is the first television film featuring the Muppets.\nIt stars Muppet performers Steve Whitmire, Dave Goelz, Bill Barretta, and Eric Jacobson, as well as Dave Arquette, Joan Cusack, Matthew Lillard, William H. Macy, and Whoopi Goldberg. The plot centers on Kermit the Frog who, after losing all hope for saving the Muppet Theatre, is assisted by an angel who shows him a world in which he was never born. The film is a homage to Frank Capra's 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life, which has a similar plot.\nThis was the first Muppets production without the involvement of veteran performer Frank Oz. Instead, Eric Jacobson performed Oz's characters Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and Animal, marking his feature film debut as those characters.\nIt's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie is the final Muppets production before the characters and franchise were acquired by The Walt Disney Company from The Jim Henson Company. It is one of the few Muppets-related productions that are currently not owned by The Walt Disney Company, and along with Sam and Friends, is currently owned by NBCUniversal.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the holiday season, the Muppet Theater is going through financial hardship, and the Muppets are seeking Kermit the Frog for guidance. Kermit eventually feels he is not useful to anyone and an angel named Daniel brings this up with his Boss as they review what has gone on with Kermit in the past hours.\nHours earlier, Kermit prepares a Christmas show with his fellow Muppets with Bobo the Bear playing Santa Claus. Kermit is approached by Rachel Bitterman, a banker/real estate agent who says she will foreclose the Muppet Theater if Kermit does not pay her. Pepe the King Prawn leaves the Muppets because he has fallen in love with Bitterman. Miss Piggy leaves the Muppets to go and work in Hollywood. While trying to raise money to pay Bitterman, Kermit tries to find a celebrity to participate in his Christmas play to no avail. Kermit travels out to California and retrieves Miss Piggy, who gets fired working as an extra on the TV series Scrubs.\nMeanwhile, after learning from Pepe that the deadline is midnight, Bitterman changes it to 6:00 p.m. Pepe overhears this and sets about informing Kermit about the deadline change, but Pepe keeps being interrupted. The Muppets perform their Christmas musical Moulin Scrooge (a parody of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!) and Pepe continues trying to talk to Kermit. The musical is a success, concluding with a standing ovation. After the show, Pepe finally explains to Kermit that the deadline has changed and shows him the contract. Kermit sends Fozzie to deliver the money to Bitterman. Fozzie confronts a crazed nature-show host (spoofing Steve Irwin), and a gang of Whos after being dyed green at a Christmas tree lot and mistaken for the Grinch by some angry Whos. Fozzie goes through the steam baths and ends up back to normal where he throws off the Whos. When Fozzie eventually makes it to the bank and Bitterman's office, he goes through a gigantic web of burning lasers leading to Bitterman's office several times before finally discovering that he is too late and that he has grabbed the wrong bag containing clothes for the Salvation Army following his incident at the Christmas tree lot.\nAfter witnessing these events, the Boss allows Daniel to help Kermit. When Daniel arrives, and after Kermit wishes he has never been born, he ends up showing Kermit what would have happened if he had not existed. In the world without Kermit, Bitterman has turned the park near the Muppet Theater into a shopping mall called Bitterman Plaza, the Muppet Theater itself has become a nightclub called Club Dot owned by Bitterman, Doc Hopper's French-Fried Frog Legs (first seen in The Muppet Movie) has become a famous fast-food restaurant, and all of Kermit's friends have fallen into various detrimental situations.\nKermit has Daniel restore him back to his reality and returns to the Muppet Theater. However, Bitterman arrives to shut the theater down and fights with Miss Piggy. Pepe arrives and announces he has made the Muppet Theater into a historical landmark, foiling Bitterman's plans. Defeated, Bitterman storms out of the Muppet Theater.\nOutside, the Muppets sing \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDavid Arquette as Daniel, an angel who appears to Kermit at Christmas.\nJoan Cusack as Rachel Bitterman, a spoiled, rich young banker/real estate developer.\nMatthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, a foppish French choreographer.\nWhoopi Goldberg as The Boss, the Creator of the Universe.\nWilliam H.

McGinley as himself/Dr. Perry Cox\nJudy Reyes as herself/Nurse Carla Espinosa\n\n\n== Production notes ==\nVeteran Muppet performer Jerry Nelson was ill during filming, so most of his characters were puppeteered on set by others and later dubbed by Nelson in post-production. The exception was Nelson's character Lew Zealand, who was performed by Bill Barretta. Sam Eagle, a character originally performed by Frank Oz, was voiced in the film by Kevin Clash, while John Kennedy provided the on set puppetry.\nScooter, performed in the film by Brian Henson, makes his first major appearance since the death of his initial performer, Richard Hunt. Hunt's character Janice was also performed by Henson and has a speaking role for the first time since Hunt's death.\nThe film contains an original song, \"Everyone Matters\", performed by Kermit and Gonzo as part of the world in which he had never been born, and then reprised at the end. The film also makes reference to the classic Muppet song \"Rainbow Connection\", featuring a statue of Kermit in a park, erected in dedication \"for the lovers, the dreamers and you\".\n\n\n== 9/11 Fan Theory ==\nThe movie was filmed after the September 11 attacks; one scene, set in a version of 2003 where Kermit was never born, shows the Twin Towers visible in the background. This was due to the photo background mural being created prior to the attacks.\nYears after the film's release, this detail gained viral attention, inspiring jokes and a fan theory that Kermit the Frog somehow indirectly led to 9/11.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Christmas films\nList of films about angels\nSanta Claus in film\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIt's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie at IMDb\nIt's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie at Rotten Tomatoes \nIt's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie on Muppet Wiki",

It was described as a \"glorious bomb\" by the Scarecrow Video Movie Guide.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJimmy is a young boy who is tired of the drudgery of his daily routine. One morning, Jimmy shouts out, \"I wish time would stop!\" At that very moment, the \"master clock\" that makes time run opens to power itself with the light of the sun, rendering it vulnerable to even a simple wish; it hears Jimmy's wish, and everyone (except Jimmy) is frozen in their tracks. Observing this catastrophe is a magical astronomer, who sends his daughter Aurora to talk Jimmy into helping her undo the damage, before the time freeze becomes permanent. As Jimmy and Aurora travel to a region called the World's End so that Jimmy can replace the magical Golden Globe in the master clock to set time running again, they are hounded by an evil wizard known as Mr. Fig, who seizes the chance to take over the world for himself. Jimmy and Aurora's travels take them through various places which include \"slow motion playground\", \"night and day land\", encounters with green-skinned Indians calling for rain, etc. all the while with Mr. Fig trying to stop them at nearly every turn on their mission.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was shot entirely in Florida in and around Coral Gables. The Coral Castle was used as the backdrop for both the Astronomer's home as well as the coral maze of the World's End at the film's climax. Its working title was The Enchanted Globe.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAllmovie panned the film, writing \"Jimmy, the Boy Wonder is crafted as crudely as anything from this director's oeuvre, resulting in a crass, slapdash kid pic that undoubtedly led to restlessness and boredom in children and angry parents at the box office arguing about refunds.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJimmy, the Boy Wonder at IMDb",

The work of writer Michael Lach and director Dale G.

Cyrus secretly works as a busboy at a club, \"Off the Street\", where the music label of their childhood friend, teenage singing sensation Roxanne \"Roxie\" Andrews, is sponsoring a songwriting contest. Roxie chooses Truth's song \"Don't Run Away\" as the winning entry but misidentifies Kris as Truth because the photo Cyrus submitted was of them both. Kris convinces Cyrus to let him keep the credit because he has feelings for Roxie. As Kris uses Cyrus' verses to get closer to both Roxie and his newfound fame, Cyrus begins to resent his friend.\nAs Cyrus and Roxie get to know each other, she says she can talk to him better than she can talk to Kris. Cyrus invites her to perform with the choir at his church. After their performance, Jacob humiliates Roxie in front of the congregation by condemning people living in \"hip-hop-crisy\". His wife Gail persuades Jacob to apologize to Roxie at the club, where he catches his son working and learns that Cyrus writes rap lyrics. At first, he's furious and grounds him, but Jacob comes to realize his son's raps carry positive messages and lifts his punishment.\nThe conflict between Cyrus and Kris comes to a head in a physical altercation. Club owner Levi convinces them not to let their friendship die. During a duet with Roxie, Cyrus takes Kris' place on the stage to sing \"Me and You\", revealing that he was Truth all along. Cyrus apologizes but Roxie storms from the stage, feeling betrayed and misled. At a rapping challenge, Cyrus calls out the pompous rapper Lord of Da Bling. Cyrus wins the trophy by revealing to the audience that Bling is a fraud, having seen him the previous week working his day job as a taxi driver.\nKris tells Roxie that Cyrus is a great person and only pretended he was not Truth for Kris.

            "Little Giants is a 1994 American family sports comedy film directed by Duwayne Dunham and written by James Ferguson, Robert Shallcross, Tommy Swerdlow, Michael Goldberg from the story by Ferguson and Robert Shallcross. The film stars Rick Moranis and Ed O'Neill as Danny and Kevin O'Shea, two brothers living in a fictional Ohio town who coach rival Pee-Wee Football teams. The film was produced by Amblin Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. under their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the fictional town of Urbania, Ohio, Danny O'Shea has always lived in the shadow of his older brother, Kevin, a Heisman Trophy winner and local football hero. Kevin coaches the \"Pee-Wee Cowboys\" football team. Despite being the best player, Danny's daughter, Becky, nicknamed Icebox, is cut during try outs solely because she is a girl. Her less-talented friends, Rashid Hanon, Tad Simpson, and Rudy Zolteck are cut as well. After being ridiculed by the players who made the team, Becky convinces her dad to coach a new pee-wee team of their own.\nDanny eventually accepts in an attempt to show Urbania that Kevin is not invincible, and that there is another O'Shea in town capable of winning. Kevin reminds him of the \"one town, one team\" rule enforced by the Pee-Wee Football League and, with the support of the locals, they decide to have a playoff game to determine the lone team that will represent Urbania. Alongside Becky, Hanon, Tad, Rudy, and Nubie (a boy who becomes assistant coach), Danny gathers other children that had not been given a chance, and dubs the team the \"Little Giants.\" One such player, strong-armed quarterback Junior Floyd, is the son of Danny's childhood crush, Patty Floyd.\nTwo old-timers, Orville and Wilbur, encourage the rivalry between Danny and Kevin, reporting to them that a new star player, Spike Hammersmith, has just moved to Urbania. Danny recruits him by tricking his father, Mike, into believing he is the famous \"Coach O'Shea\". However, Spike refuses to play on a team with a girl. The deception is later discovered and he switches over to Kevin's team. Kevin also encourages his daughter Debbie to become a cheerleader and tells Becky that a quarterback will want to date a cheerleader, not a teammate. She chooses to quit the Giants and pursue cheerleading, believing that it would be her best chance to win over Junior in addition to feeling exploited as her father's best player. Just as Danny's team begins to lose hope, a bus arrives carrying NFL stars John Madden, Emmitt Smith, Bruce Smith, Tim Brown, and Steve Emtman. They teach the kids about football and inspire them to believe they can win.\nThe day of the game, Kevin goads Danny into making a bet: If Danny wins, he gets Kevin's Chevrolet dealership; if Kevin wins, he gets Danny's gas station. Facing a 21-point halftime deficit, the Giants' spirits are lifted when Danny gives them a speech, inspiring them to each remember a time when they had a unique accomplishment. He reassures them that they only need to beat the Cowboys one time to prove themselves. With this, they begin to play better and make a comeback. Realizing that Junior is the main threat to the Cowboys, Mike Hammersmith orders Spike to take him out of the game; Spike injures Junior by spearing him with his helmet after the whistle. Kevin reprimands Mike for his son's unsportsmanlike conduct and warns him  that Spike will be kicked off the team if it happens again. \nWitnessing the attack on Junior from the sidelines, an enraged Becky drops her pompoms and suits up for the game, wearing her Giants uniform and pads over her cheerleader's outfit. She immediately makes an impact when she forces a fumble after a hit on Spike. In the game's closing seconds with the score tied at 21, the Giants make a goal line stand when Becky stops Spike. With time remaining for one final play, their offense steps back onto the field and uses a play Nubie calls \"The Annexation of Puerto Rico,\" inspired by Tom Osborne's \u201cfumblerooski\u201d. The play includes three different ball carriers, utilizing the hook and lateral from Zolteck, to Junior, and finally to Berman, who scores the Giants' 99 yard game-winning touchdown.\nAfterwards, Danny suggests that rather than having the Giants solely represent Urbania, they should merge with the Cowboys, so that both he and Kevin can coach the team. Danny and Patty rekindle their childhood romance. He also decides not to hold Kevin to the prior bet, on the stipulation that the town water tower be changed from \"Home of Kevin O'Shea\" to \"Home of The O'Shea Brothers,\" reflecting a much earlier promise that Kevin made to Danny from their childhood.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was inspired by a 1992 McDonald's Super Bowl commercial developed by Jim Ferguson and Bob Shallcross. According to The Baltimore Sun, after seeing the commercial, Steven Spielberg contacted them and said, \"I want that commercial made into a movie. I want my 'Home Alone.'\" It was filmed from May 10 to Sep 3, 1994.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film received mixed reviews. Stephen Holden remarked, in The New York Times, that \"anyone who was ever rejected or picked last for a team can relate to the concept behind \"Little Giants,\" a slickly contrived family movie about an inept junior football team that succeeds in spite of spectacular liabilities [...]\"Little Giants,\" which was directed by Duwayne Dunham, devotes much of its energy to such comic antics as balls getting stuck into face masks, and wispy little kids practicing looking intimidating.\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post stated that \"if \"Little Giants\" were in a beauty pageant it might win votes for Miss Congeniality, but it definitely wouldn't take the crown.\" Conversely, the Los Angeles Times suggested that the film was \"smarter than many of its ilk. Clearly a great deal of care and thought has gone into making special a picture that could so easily have been routine family fare.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds a 50% approval rating with a 5.6/10 average rating, based on 14 reviews. Despite negative feedback and abysmal box office performance, the film has since been regarded as a cult classic.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film had a budget of $20 million and failed to recoup it, with a total of $19.3 million in box office returns, making it a disappointment at the box office.\n\n\n=== Year-end lists ===\nTop 10 worst disasters (Ranked #1 in Top 100 Harshest Defense-On-Defense Insults)\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nIn a 2010 NCAA football game, Michigan State defeated Notre Dame on a fake field goal touchdown pass in overtime to end the game. Head coach Mark Dantonio said the play was called \"Little Giants\".\nThe uniforms worn by the Cowboys in the film were the same ones worn by the Dallas Cowboys during the 1994 season as part of the NFL's 75th anniversary. From 2004 to 2007, the New York Giants' alternate jerseys were red with white numerals, similar to the jerseys worn by the Little Giants in the movie.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nOn February 7, 1995, Warner Home Video released Little Giants on VHS and LaserDisc. The VHS tape includes a Merrie Melodies cartoon, One Froggy Evening, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Michigan J. Frog. On July 8, 2003, the film was released on DVD.  On March 29, 2011, the film was re-released in a four pack: 4 Film Favorites: Kids Sports (along with Little Big League, Surf Ninjas, and Hometown Legend).\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American football films\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLittle Giants at IMDb\nLittle Giants at Rotten Tomatoes\nLittle Giants at Box Office Mojo",
            "Little Manhattan is a 2005 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Mark Levin and written by Jennifer Flackett, starring Josh Hutcherson and Charlotte Ray Rosenberg. It is set in Manhattan, and follows a ten-year-old boy as he experiences his first love.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nGabe, an adventurous 10-year-old boy, lives in Manhattan with his parents who are on the verge of divorcing. Gabe spends most of his free time exploring the city on his scooter. His daily exploits are followed and encouraged by the friendly concierge at his building. Gabe encounters Rosemary, an 11-year-old classmate whom he's known since kindergarten, in a self-defense class. After being partnered with her for sparring, he suddenly notices her as a girl, not another face. To Gabe's elation, they begin spending time together and he is completely enamored with not only her, but her life. Rosemary lives with her loving upper-class parents on the edge of Central Park. One day, Gabe takes Rosemary on a tour through Central Park, and another day they venture across the city for fun. They travel to Septuaguesimo Uno, Manhattan's smallest park, and try to inspect an apartment for rent, worrying Gabe's nervous parents. Rosemary's parents take them to hear a jazz pianist at The Carlyle, where the young twosome finally hold hands. After the show, Rosemary's parents tell them to say goodnight and her parents go to get milk. After they walk off, Gabe and Rosemary begin talking, and he interrupts her by kissing her.\nRosemary's family's life is in contrast to Gabe's; his parents have declared an awkward truce while waiting for their divorce to be finalized. As their relationship progresses, Gabe begins to question what is happening to him and why he is falling in love with Rosemary. To complicate matters, he discovers Rosemary is going to summer camp for six weeks and her parents are enrolling her in a private school when she returns. When things seem to be going perfectly, Gabe's world is turned upside down when he and Rosemary are assigned new sparring partners. Gabe is jealous of Rosemary's new partner, a tall blonde boy who's much better at self-defense than Gabe is. With their remaining time running out, Gabe tries to get closer to Rosemary, but only drives her away. In a desperate move to win Rosemary back, Gabe attempts to show off and earn his yellow belt, but painfully fractures his hand in the process.\nBeing crushed with what love really is, he learns from his father that his parents' marriage fell apart because of things left unsaid. Realizing he is running out of time, Gabe goes to find Rosemary at a wedding reception she is attending and declares his love. Taken aback, Rosemary replies she does not think she is ready for love, but is really happy to see Gabe and asks him to dance. As they dance, Gabe muses that he and Rosemary were on different paths\u2014\"like two ships that passed in Sheep Meadow\". He returns home to find his parents laughing over their honeymoon recollections. Gabe is pleased and surprised when his father says he \"cleared out some old stuff\" and his parents appear to have reconciled. They happily go out for dinner, and as the movie ends, Gabe, narrating, summarizes what Rosemary meant to him: \"...I'm never gonna get another first love. That one's always gonna be her.\"\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJosh Hutcherson as Gabriel \"Gabe\" Burton, the main protagonist who falls in love with Rosemary Telesco\nCharlotte Ray Rosenberg  (credited as Charlie Ray) as Rosemary Telesco, Gabe's love interest\nBradley Whitford and Cynthia Nixon as Adam Burton and Leslie Burton, Gabe's parents\nWillie Garson as Ralph, the elevator man who's nice to Gabe\nTonye Patano as Birdie, Rosemary's nanny\nLeigha and Juliette Nicoloro as Mae-Li, Rosemary's three-year-old sister\nJosh Pais as Ronny, Leslie's new date\nMichael Bush as Max, a boy who's one of Gabe's friends\nJohn Dossett and Talia Balsam as Mickey and Jackie Telesco, Rosemary's parents\nJonah Meyerson as Sam, a boy who is also one of Gabe's friends\nBrian W.

Levin and Flackett wanted to make a project as directors, and an adolescent love story had the benefit of not being a project led by a star actor. They believed they could make it for a reasonable budget. From concept to completed script, it took about two months and the film was greenlit shortly after that.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nLittle Manhattan received mostly positive reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 77% based on reviews from 31 critics. The site's consensus states: \"Little Manhattan is a sweet story of young love that provides an enlightening if pragmatic view on love and courtship.\" Metacritic gave it a score of 52 based on 10 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nBBC's Stella Papamichael wrote that the film was \"sweet but not syrupy and heart-warming without being manipulative, this kid flick stands tall among recent Hollywood love stories\". Kevin Thomas, writing for the Los Angeles Times, called the film \"a handsome charmer about the avalanche of first love...an endearing, affectionately humorous and even lyrical depiction of the dawning of adolescence amid the privileged\". Thomas called the script \"problematic...[Gabe's] speech as soundtrack narrator of his own story is precociously improbable\". Jeffrey Lyons of NBC called Little Manhattan \"one of the sweetest, most touching films you'll see\". Variety's Brian Lowry was less positive about the film. He wrote \"Resting almost entirely on the shoulders of its young leads, both they and the pic lack the sparkle to sustain what seeks to be a whimsical premise but, except for a few moments, proves ponderous instead.\" He also believed the film belonged on \"youth-targeting basic-cable networks\" instead of having a cinematic release.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film made $36,397 in the opening weekend in the United States. By December 18, 2005, the film had grossed $385,373. It had worldwide box office takings of $1,117,920.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe film's score was composed by Chad Fischer, the guitarist and lead singer of Lazlo Bane.\nThe film also featured 18 other songs, half of which are covers, by a variety of musicians, from the well-known The Beatles and Elvis Presley to little-known The Meadows and Loston Harris. Chad Fischer contributed several songs to the film both as a performer and producer.\nThe soundtrack album for the film hasn't been released, making half of the songs used exclusive to the film.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nLittle Manhattan at IMDb\nLittle Manhattan at Box Office Mojo",

            "Little Secrets is a 2001 American comedy-drama family film directed by Blair Treu. It was produced by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment and stars Evan Rachel Wood, Michael Angarano, and David Gallagher. The film follows Emily (played by Wood), a 14-year-old aspiring violinist who runs a secret-keeping booth in her neighborhood, offering the other children advice when they confess their secrets to her. Complicating Emily's life are her soon-to-be-born sibling and the two teenage brothers (Angarano and Gallagher) who move in next door. Emily soon finds herself unraveling under the weight of all the secrets, including one of her own.\nThe film is the second collaboration between Treu and writer Jessica Barondes, having previously teamed up for Disney Channel's Wish Upon a Star (1996). A proponent of family-oriented media, Treu wanted to make a grounded and character-driven film with a positive message, something he felt contemporary Hollywood was lacking. To prepare for what she considered her first family-friendly role, Wood spent two months learning how to mimic playing the violin. Little Secrets was shot on location in Salt Lake City in the summer of 2001, with local child actors rounding out the supporting roles. Utah-based composer Sam Cardon provided the score.\nLittle Secrets premiered at the Heartland Film Festival on October 21, 2001, under its original title Secret Keeper. It was also screened at the Salt Lake Children's Film Festival, before being released theatrically by the independent film company Samuel Goldwyn Films on August 23, 2002. Wood's performance was widely praised, but while some critics found the film wholesome and sweet, others derided it as superficial and bland. Commercially, the film grossed $750,582 at the box office.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nEmily, a 14-year-old aspiring concert violinist, spends her summer practicing for an important audition to get into the local youth symphony orchestra in Salt Lake City. Due to Emily's knack for keeping secrets, she also runs a secret-keeping booth, charging the neighborhood children fifty cents for advice as they divulge their personal secrets to her. Emily herself is harboring a secret from her friends: that she is adopted. At home, Emily's parents are expecting a baby, having been unable to conceive a child of their own until now. Her parents' excitement over the baby leaves Emily feeling jealous.\nMeanwhile, 12-year-old Philip and his family move in next door to Emily. While helping unpack, Philip accidentally breaks one of his father's valuable chess pieces and is caught by Emily as he attempts to hide it in the garden. Emily and Philip get off to a rocky start when she charges him fifty cents to keep this incident a secret from his parents, but Philip begins to take an interest in her after watching her play the violin. Emily invites Philip over for afternoon tea and they bond over having a shared secret after they accidentally break two expensive china teacups. As Philip's crush grows, he begins taking piano lessons in an attempt to impress her.\nDavid, Philip's 15-year-old brother, returns home early from tennis camp, having been expelled when he and other campers were involved in a car accident after having a few beers. Philip does not think it is a big deal, as David was not the driver and no one was legally drunk, but the woman in the other car was injured. Philip reveals David's secret to Emily in exchange for learning the meaning behind her secret greeting with her best friends. He is confused when Emily reacts angrily to what David did. Emily and David meet and are immediately attracted to each other, causing a jealous Philip to steal Emily's clients for his own secret-keeping booth. David tries to get closer to Emily, but she keeps her distance due to her knowledge of his secret. At the same time, the advice Emily gave to the neighborhood children starts to blow up in her face. She begins to unravel under the pressure of keeping all these secrets and it affects her violin playing.\nAt her mother's baby shower, David tries once again to talk to Emily and she reveals that she knows his secret. David confronts Philip, and an angry Philip reveals to Emily's best friends that she broke their secret greeting pact. After a heart-to-heart with her violin teacher Pauline, Emily resolves to stop keeping secrets. She goes to retrieve her violin that she left on the roof, but loses her balance and falls, necessitating a trip to the hospital and causing her to miss her audition. Feeling guilty, the brothers go to the audition on her behalf and manage to get Emily a place in the youth orchestra by showing the panelists a tape of her playing the violin. While she is in the hospital, her mother also gives birth to her new sister whom Emily names Grace. Emily tells her friends that she is adopted and that her birth parents were killed by a drunk driver when she was an infant. David finally understands why Emily was so upset at him and promises never to do something like that again. David also tells Emily that if she wants to be close to someone, she can't keep secrets from them. After she is released from the hospital, Emily and Philip reaffirm their friendship and he helps her close her secret-keeping booth for good. Philip gives Emily and David his blessing, and Emily and David share a kiss. The film ends with Emily receiving a new violin as a gift and viewing the outside neighborhood.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nLittle Secrets was directed by Blair Treu and written by Jessica Barondes. It is Treu and Barondes' second collaboration, having previously made Wish Upon a Star (1996) together for the Disney Channel. The film was produced by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment; Don Schain, Treu and Barondes served as producers. Both Treu and Barondes noted that there was no studio interference with the making of the film. The film was scored by Utah-based composer Sam Cardon.\nAs a filmmaker, Treu specialized in heartwarming family entertainment that is appropriate for children but still substantive. He believed that films like Little Secrets fill a gap in the market by appealing to a segment of the population that contemporary Hollywood has neglected. He added, \"More than promoting this movie, I'm trying to promote this kind of movie.\" Barondes considered the themes in the film to be ubiquitous, saying, \"I think the things I write about are pretty timeless. They could have been made in the '70s, '80s, and here we are in the 2000s, and hopefully it will work and will hang around.\"\nTreu wanted the plot to be grounded and character-driven, and at the crux of the story is Emily grappling with the emotional weight and consequences of keeping so many secrets. Another subplot is the love triangle between Emily and the two brothers, Philip and David. Treu highlighted the friendship between Emily and Philip as his favorite storyline to develop. While he acknowledged that many of the film's young audiences were probably rooting for Philip to \"get the girl\" at the end, Treu felt it was more realistic that Emily would choose the older David.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nIn April 2001, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Wood was to star in the film. Treu had auditioned a few actresses before landing on her for the role of Emily. The actress was keen to join the production and work with a cast that was primarily children, noting that this was the first family-friendly project she had ever done. Wood described her character as passionate, especially in her dedication to the violin; while Treu said that Emily \"likes to be in control\" and \"really enjoys being involved in the lives of her younger neighbors\".\nWood appears in almost every scene in the film and Treu was impressed by her professionalism, recalling how she could shoot an emotional scene, take a break to attend school, then return to the set and pick up right where she left off in the scene. Because she did not know how to play the violin, Wood spent two months prior to filming learning how to mime playing the instrument along to the music. Even though the actual sound she produced did not matter, with Wood describing her violin playing on set as sounding like \"fingernails on a chalkboard\", she was surprised by how difficult it was to make her miming look realistic. Treu explained Wood's preparation process:\n\nI shot a little instructional video with a violinist of the tune she would be playing in the film. We sent it along with the violin and the bow to mimic the action and the posture. [...] When she got to location in Salt Lake City, we did a little fine-tuning with an instructor to get the fingering down. But she was ready to go. She did her homework.\nMeanwhile, auditions were not held for the role of Philip because Treu knew early on that he wanted Angarano for the part. Gallagher was cast as the \"hunky\" David, with Treu stating that the actor personified the \"red-blooded all-American young man\" and had a natural charisma that drew girls in. The director also noted that despite his young age, Gallagher had been acting for such a long time that he probably had the most on-set experience of the cast.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nLittle Secrets was shot on a small budget in the summer of 2001. Like the majority of Treu's previous productions, filming took place entirely on location in Salt Lake City, Utah, with specific locales including Downtown Salt Lake City and the area around Cottonwood Mall. Local child actors were cast in many of the supporting roles. For the neighborhood scenes in the film, Treu returned to the same location that he had previously shot Wish Upon a Star in. Treu favored this particular neighborhood due to its unique setting that consisted of newly built houses surrounded by old-growth trees, resulting in what he felt was a \"magical quality\". Moreover, the houses were relatively big and had high ceilings, making them ideal for filming.\nTime was of the essence for the filmmakers, as the young cast was attending school and could only shoot for a few hours each day. To that effect, cinematographer Brian Sullivan set up shots rapidly. Treu credited Sullivan for the film's \"crisp\" and \"colorful\" visual quality, which he felt exuded a big-budget look. Despite the tight schedule, Treu wanted to maintain a relaxed working environment; actress Vivica A. Fox recalled the mood on set as being positive and wholesome, while Wood described the experience as \"very laid back\".\n\n\n== Release ==\nOriginally titled Secret Keeper, the film premiered on October 21, 2001, at the Heartland Film Festival in Indianapolis. According to Heartland's president Jeff Sparks, it sold a record number of tickets to become the most popular film in the festival's history. The film, now retitled Little Secrets, went on to have its first screening in Utah on August 19, 2002, when it headlined the Salt Lake Children's Film Festival.\nTriStar Pictures and Samuel Goldwyn Films agreed to give the film a limited theatrical release, and it opened in 366 theaters in the United States on August 23, 2002. In its debut weekend, it ranked 30th at the box office, grossing $191,747 with a per-screen average of $523. The film dropped out of the top-100 list in its third weekend until its last screening in 12 theaters in its fifth weekend, grossing $2,364 and ranking 127th. Overall, Little Secrets closed out a disappointing theatrical run grossing $405,792 domestically and $344,790 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $750,582.\nIt was released on VHS and DVD by Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment on February 4, 2003, with bonus features including outtakes, a commentary track by Treu and Barondes, a \"making-of\" featurette, and the film's soundtrack on a separate CD.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 60% of 48 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Little Secrets is wholesome entertainment for the kids, but also rather bland.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.\nIn The New York Times, Dave Kehr wrote that Wood has a screen presence that belies her young age. Overall, he concluded that \"Little Secrets is a sunny, pleasant, squeaky-clean family film in which nothing surprising happens, and that is the point\". People magazine found the film \"borderline saccharine\" despite a credible performance by Wood, while Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times and David Noh of the Film Journal International likened it to an after school special. The News Tribune's Soren Andersen and The Indianapolis Star's Bonnie Britton were both full of praise for Wood, but noted that the plot was too contrived at times. Despite its flaws, Macdonald, Noh, Andersen, and Britton were all won over by the film's earnest, well-meaning intentions, which they felt were a respite from the other overly-commercialized or vacuous children's films.\nIn a negative review, The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck found that the storylines play out in such a lazy and uninspiring manner, and that Wood's performance was the only noteworthy highlight in an otherwise boring film. Similarly, Variety's Scott Foundas commended Wood for \"bringing as much charm and subtlety to the part as the one-dimensional script and clunky direction will allow\". Foundas was also critical of the characterization of the young protagonists, who in his opinion must have been written by adults who have forgotten how actual children behave. Scheck was equally unimpressed with the adult cast, save for the \"always lively\" Fox. In contrast, The Salt Lake Tribune's Brandon Griggs felt the child characters were handled authentically and respectfully, while Crosswalk.com's Holly McClure appreciated the realistic depiction of the adult characters. Overall, McClure gave Little Secrets a positive review, with particular praise for its universal theme concerning secrets and lies.\nKevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times bemoaned the superficial, idyllic world the story was set in, a trend he felt was all-too-common in the family genre. Yet despite its \"greeting card look and feel\", he thought the film's moral was intriguing and handled skilfully by the filmmakers. Thomas also praised the three teenage leads, although he quibbled that Wood was a little \"actressy\" at times. David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor concurred that the characters and settings were unrealistically wholesome, giving the film a sitcom-like quality. Even so, both Thomas and Sterritt recommended the film as satisfying entertainment for family audiences.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLittle Secrets at AllMovie\nLittle Secrets at IMDb",

            "MGM Children's Matinees were a series of vintage MGM family films curated by executive Tony Myerberg that were re-released to theatres between 1970 and 1973. As the name implies, they were shown only as Saturday and Sunday matin\u00e9es. The series was likely inspired by the success of lower-budgeted childrens' films released on weekend matinees by K. Gordon Murray and Barry Yellen's Childhood Productions.\n\n\n== List of titles ==\nThe films ranged from old favorites such as The Wizard of Oz (1939), Lassie Come Home (1943), and The Secret Garden (1949), to later widescreen films such as the 1960 remake of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, to then-recent fare such as Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion.\nIt also featured the 1970 Chuck Jones cult feature The Phantom Tollbooth.\n\n\n== History ==\nAll the trailers for the films in the series were newly created, using footage from the original trailers of the films, and combining them with new narration.  For example, the narration for the series trailer for Forbidden Planet targeted the boys in the audience and focused solely on the science fiction elements, and \"Robby the Robot\", and none of the romance between Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis.\nThe series was officially discontinued after 1973, though in some markets, theatres continued to program films using MGM's ad materials into the late 1970s.\n\n\n== Competitors ==\nTony Myerberg left MGM, and set up a similar franchise at Paramount Pictures, Paramount Family Matinee, that also repackaged reissues of family films owned by the studio like Hello Down There (1968), Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), Black Beauty (1971), and Charlotte's Web (1973), with acquisitions from other producers, including Alice in a New Wonderland (1966), Tom Thumb (1972), Aladdin and His Magic Lamp (1970), The Magic of the Kite (1958), Kingdom in the Clouds (1969), Rumpelstiltskin (1955), Heidi, Child of the Mountain (1952) and its sequel Heidi and Peter (1955).\nThe series officially ran from 1974 until 1976.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClubhouse Pictures, the family-friendly label of Atlantic Releasing Corporation that ran from 1986 until 1987.\nWarner Bros.

            "Misty is a 1961 American CinemaScope children's film based on Marguerite Henry's 1947 award-winning children's book Misty of Chincoteague.\nThe book tells a story of the special bond that develops between two young orphan children and a centuries-old herd of wild ponies living on an island off the coast of Virginia and a real-life Chincoteague Pony named Misty.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nEvery year the Chincoteague fire department rounds up the wild ponies of Assateague Island and holds an auction to thin out the herd. The young children set out to raise enough money in hopes that the Phantom will be caught in this years round up. They soon realize they will get more than they bargained for when the Phantom has a surprise for everyone: a foal named Misty.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDavid Ladd as Paul Beebe\nArthur O'Connell as Grandpa Beebe\nPam Smith as Maureen Beebe\nAnne Seymour as Grandma Beebe\nDuke Farley as Eba Jones\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film followed the success of A Dog of Flanders and was made with the same star, producer and director. \"Children want a good story, preferably dealing with a good locale,\" said producer Radnitz.\nSet on the island of Chincoteague on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, Misty was filmed in Chincoteague, at a home on Folly Creek near the town of Accomac, and on the nearby barrier island known as Assateague.\nThe story is based on the annual \"Pony Swim\", an event held in the Chincoteague area each year, that involves rounding up some of the wild ponies who live on Assateague Island to swim across the channel.  Some of the colts and yearlings are then sold at auction as a means of thinning out the herd, and as a benefit for the local Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department.\nThe story features two real life characters of Chincoteague, Paul and Maureen Beebe, a young brother and sister who move from Philadelphia to Chincoteague, Virginia to live with Grandpa Beebe and Grandma Beebe after their parents die. Paul and Maureen befriend an elusive mare on Assateague named the Phantom, and later come to own her foal, Misty.  Using local people from the town in most of the roles, the film stars only six professional actors, including Arthur O'Connell, Anne Seymour, Pam Smith, and future Hollywood executive David Ladd. The horse Misty was played in the film by another pony, although the real Misty can be seen in some scenes.\nThe film was made with a budget of $705,000 and was directed by James B. Clark. The film's cinematography was by Lee Garmes and Leo Tover, and the music by Paul Sawtell and Bert Shefter.\nAt the premier showing of the movie on Chincoteague in 1961, the real Misty was led down Main Street, and her front hoof prints were impressed into cement in front of the Island Theatre (now managed by the Chincoteague Island Arts Organization), where the impressions of her hooves can still be seen as of 2023. Both the book and the movie brought widespread publicity to Chincoteague and Assateague, and to the local culture, traditions, and natural beauty and wildlife on the remote and isolated barrier islands of the United States' eastern coast.\n\n\n== The Ash Wednesday storm of 1962 ==\nThe coastal area on the Atlantic Ocean is no stranger to volatile weather. The year after the film was released, a winter storm, one of the worst Nor'easters to ever occur there, struck. During what came to be known as the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962, the Beebe family, the real-life owners of Misty, brought her inside their home to weather the storm. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a foal, which the children named \"Stormy.\" This prompted author Henry to write a sequel, Stormy, Misty's Foal, published in 1963.  Henry had already written a previous sequel, Sea Star: Orphan of Chincoteague, published in 1949.\n\n\n== Legacy of book & film ==\nPossibly due in part to publicity from Ms. Henry's books and the movie, most of Assateague Island was protected from development by the enactment of Federal legislation designating it as Assateague Island National Seashore in 1965, under the administration of the National Park Service.\nThe annual \"Pony Swim\" and the auction continue on Virginia's Eastern Shore, helping both the community of Chincoteague and the herd of wild ponies.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nMisty is available on DVD.

            "Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front is a 2006 American made-for-television comedy-drama film. It is the third movie in the American Girl film series, and is based on the Molly: An American Girl book series written by American children's author Valerie Tripp. The first two movies in the series, Samantha: An American Girl Holiday and Felicity: An American Girl Adventure, were broadcast on The WB Television Network. However, following the WB/UPN merger, the series moved to the Disney Channel. The film premiered on the Disney Channel and on DVD from Warner Home Video on November 26, 2006. The film stars Maya Ritter in the titular role, with Molly Ringwald, David Aaron Baker, Tory Green and Genevieve Farrell in supporting roles.\nThe film was directed by Joyce Chopra, with Deborah Schindler as executive producer. Screenwriter Anna Sandor won the 2007 Humanitas Prize for the movie.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1943, during World War II, nine-year-old Molly McIntire lives in the fictional town of Jefferson, Illinois with her parents, James and Helen, and two older siblings, fourteen-year-old Jill and twelve-year-old Ricky. James is a doctor in the United States Army, while Helen is a stay-at-home mom. Molly is in the third grade at Willow Street School along with her two best friends, Linda and Susan. As Molly's tenth birthday nears, she dreams of having a princess-themed tea party inspired by Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose of England, only to be disappointed as she learns that her family does not have the money nor rations to afford it.\nJames takes Molly to a Victory Dance contest at the local park where he gives her a locket. Later that night during an air raid drill, James reveals that he has decided to go to London to provide medical aid to soldiers and civilians. Molly is furious that her father is leaving the family and going to a \"strange\" and \"unsafe\" city. James comforts Molly by calling her his North Star and telling her to look at the stars to think of him. After James departs to Europe, Helen decides to enter the workforce to do her part for the war effort, taking a factory job at the fictional Jefferson Aircraft Plant. The McIntire's neighbor, Mrs. Gilford, begins coming over in the daytime to watch the children while Helen is away at work. Molly then decides she wants to be the school's \"Miss Victory\", the lead tap-dance performer in the school's Christmas Pageant. She struggles to improve her tap-dancing, but with the help of her teacher Ms. Campbell, she begins to see improvement.\nSoon after, the McIntires take in a British girl named Emily Bennett. Molly is unaccepting of the McIntire's new guest while Jill insists she must learn to adapt to her new situation and do her part. Fascinated by Emily, Molly's friends Linda and Susan question Emily about her home in London; overwhelmed, Emily lies and says her parents are royalty, and that she lived in \"Bennett Manor\". At school, Emily becomes popular amongst the students, particularly with Molly's tap-dancing rival Allison Hargate. This causes Molly to resent her. The two later participate in a spelling bee together. Before a winner can be declared, a member of the Western Union arrives to inform Ms. Campbell, who is on the panel of judges, that her fianc\u00e9 has been killed in the war.\nLater, another air raid drill occurs, upsetting Emily as the McIntires shelter in the basement of their home. That night, Emily wakes up in the midst of a nightmare. She reveals to Molly that her street was bombed in The Blitz, destroying her parents' apartment and killing her mother. She says her father is a bus driver and that they lived above a candy shop, and that she was never really royalty. Molly forgives her and the two become friends.\nAfter returning home from school one day, Molly finds her mother Helen making a casserole for Mrs. Gilford, whose son has been killed in action. Empathetic, Molly helps her bake and deliver the casserole to Mrs. Gilford's house. Molly's Aunt Eleanor comes to stay with the McIntire's to help with the children and housework while Mrs. Gilford is grieving. Her stay is short-lived, though, as she eventually leaves for Texas to join the WASPs.\nAs Christmas nears, auditions for the role of \"Miss Victory\" conclude at school. Molly finds that she has been chosen for the lead role, but her excitement is short-lived as the McIntires receive a telegram stating her father is missing in action. The following day, Molly goes to the cinema where she sees a newsreel inspiring her to participate in the war effort at home. She helps create care packages for Allied soldiers in conjunction with the Red Cross, as well as collecting old clothes and making bandage boxes for soldiers overseas. While setting up the Christmas decorations in the house, another telegram from the Western Union arrives. It says James has been found alive but has been hospitalized, and that he will be discharged and sent home as soon as he is well enough to travel.\nOn Christmas Eve, Molly performs as Miss Victory at the Christmas Pageant when her father, James, surprises her after the finale. Though his leg is wounded and he relies on a cane, the family is ecstatic to see him and relieved that he is alive. The family goes home to enjoy their Christmas Eve and open presents. Molly receives a Red Cross doll while Emily receives a copy of A Christmas Carol from her father, whom James encountered while he was abroad.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMaya Ritter as Molly McIntire, the 10-year-old protagonist of the film.\nTory Green as Emily Bennett, a girl from England who is taken in by Molly's family during the war.\nHannah Fleming as Susan Shapiro, one of Molly's best friends.\nSamantha Somer Wilson as Linda Rinaldi, one of Molly's best friends.\nJosette Halpert as Alison Hargate, a rich, popular girl in Molly's class.\nDavid Aaron Baker as Dr. James McIntire, Molly's father who leaves for England to help wounded soldiers and civilians.\nMolly Ringwald as Helen McIntire, Molly's mother who takes a job assembling war machinery after Mr. McIntire leaves.\nGenevieve Farrell as Jill McIntire, Molly's 14-year-old sister.\nAndrew Chalmers as Ricky McIntire, Molly's 12-year-old brother.\nThomas Brodie-Sangster as boy in spelling bee\n\n\n== Production ==\nBefore scriptwriting for the movie began, screenwriter Anna Sandor began by reviewing and reading the original Molly book series written by children's author Valerie Tripp. Various changes were made from the books in order to adapt the series into a single movie, such as removing Molly's five-year-old brother Brad and changing elements of Emily's backstory.  After the script was completed, casting began in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto. Twelve-year-old Maya Ritter, who had previously appeared on the Disney Channel as Zoe in Disney Bumpers, as well as Zelly in Finn's Girl, was cast in the lead role as Molly. Additionally, due to Ritter's young age at the time of a filming and strict child labor laws, acting double McKayla Kenny was cast to replace Ritter in several shots during long work days. Amongst those cast was 1980s Hollywood legend Molly Ringwald, who had just returned from living in France at the time of filming.\nOver thirty costumes were created or rented for Maya; over half of them were designed by Trysha Bakker, who referenced Nick Backes' and Chris Fox Payne's original Molly illustrations as well as magazines and children's clothes from the period.

            "Muppet Classic Theater (also known as Muppet Family Theater in the Republic of Ireland and Muppet Fairy Tales in the United Kingdom) is a direct-to-video musical comedy film featuring The Muppets. It is the first direct-to-video feature film in The Muppets franchise. The film was released on September 27, 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIt consists of six stories from the fairy tale tradition, all performed by the Muppet characters and narrated by Gonzo and Rizzo at the Muppet Theater:\n\n\n=== The Three Little Pigs ===\nA Papa pig tells his three children Andy, Randy, and Sandy (played by Miss Piggy) that it is time for them all to live on their own. Papa tells Andy and Randy that they are strong smart boys who can take care of themselves, but they need to look after their sister Sandy. While the two brothers build flimsy homes of straw and sticks, Sandy constructs a state-of-the-art brick house. At night, The Big Bad Wolf comes and blows down Andy and Randy's houses. The siblings turn to Sandy for shelter, and she only lets them stay if they promise to show her some respect. The Big Bad Wolf returned the next day demanding that Sandy lets him in and reminds the pigs that they are supposed to say \"Not By the Hair of My Chinny Chin Chin.\" Sandy opens up the door and karate chops the Big Bad Wolf when she accuses him of his claim that she has facial hair. The Big Bad Wolf then starts to blow Sandy's house down which has no effect. Then the Big Bad Wolf disguises himself as the pizza delivery man only for Sandy to take the pizza. The Big Bad Wolf's last plan involves dressing up as Santa Claus and going down the chimney. Andy and Randy almost fall for this until Sandy reminds them that it is the middle of summer. When Andy and Randy think that Santa Claus came early, Sandy ends up lighting a large firecracker in the chimney which launches the Big Bad Wolf into the sky.\nSong: \"Show Me Some Respect\"\n\n\n=== King Midas ===\nKing Midas (played by Kermit the Frog) spares the life of a satyr (played by Gonzo) that was sleeping in his garden after the satyr offers to grant King Midas a wish. While King Midas wants world peace, Queen Midas (Played by Piggy) wants money and they are granted the Golden Touch. King Midas then uses his talents to turn people's items into gold. When King Midas accidentally turns himself to gold, Queen Midas tries various attempts to get him back to normal. The satyr tells her that the effects of the Golden Touch can be undone if she renounces her interest in gold. The satyr then offers to give King and Queen Midas another wish for free. While King Midas still wanted world peace, Queen Midas wanted a Slice-O-Matic in green. Rizzo the Rat narrated that King Midas, Queen Midas, and the satyr used the Slice-O-Matic to throw fabulous dinner parties for everyone in the kingdom.\nSong: \"The Midas Touch\"\n\n\n=== The Boy Who Cried Wolf ===\nThe repeated overreactions of a young shepherd (played by Gonzo) cause the villagers and their mayor (played by Kermit) to doubt his word when he has made claims of sensing earthquakes and tidal waves. When the wolf shows up and challenges the shepherd to obtain help within 24 hours before he eats his sheep, the shepherd goes through numerous attempts to prove that the wolf is threatening the sheep. After all attempts have failed, the sheep state that the shepherd learned his lesson and protested to end the story before the wolf arrives. Rizzo the Rat narrates that the story is not over yet despite the protests of the sheep and that the wolf would return in one hour. One of the rams mentions to the shepherd and his fellow sheep about his cousin Norman and they come up with a plan. When the wolf arrives, the shepherd stated that the wolf was right about the drop in his credibility as his final quote to him is \"big sheep.\" The wolf ends up being surprised by the arrival of a large ram named Norman who ends up crushing the wolf. The shepherd and the sheep then chant Norman's name. The mayor gives the shepherd a medal for \"not crying wolf except when an actual wolf was present\". The townspeople and the sheep rejoiced and lived happily ever after while the wolf is still trapped under Norman.

The King also tells his Loyal Royal Advisor that he will be given his own castle if he succeeds. All the fairest maidens in the land were brought to the King's castle so that one of them can become queen. Wanting the attention of the King, a miller claims to the Loyal Royal Advisor that his daughter Piggy can spin straw into gold when he brings her to the King's Castle. Piggy is placed in a room full of straw where the Loyal Royal Advisor orders her to demonstrate her gift that her father claims that she has or else she will be spending the rest of her life in the dungeon. She ends up receiving the assistance of Rumpelstiltskin (played by Gonzo) who spins the straw into gold upon Piggy giving him her necklace. The next morning, the Loyal Royal Advisor discovers the golden straw and states that he will keep an eye on the gold that is present while Piggy spins a second batch of straw into gold. When Rumpelstiltskin returns that night and wants a fee to convert the straw into gold, she is forced by fate to give up her firstborn upon becoming queen in return for the desperately needed services of Rumpelstiltskin. The next morning, the King and the Loyal Royal Advisor came in and found the golden straw. The King married Piggy and the Loyal Royal Advisor got his own castle. When Queen Piggy finally had her child, Rumpelstiltskin came in and states that he will let her keep her child if he can guess his name. If she cannot guess his name by tomorrow, then the child will end up in the possession of Rumpelstiltskin. Piggy called the King, the Loyal Royal Advisor, and her father where she told them the whole truth about her having help in converting straw into gold. The King mentioned that he married Piggy because he loved her and not because of her supposed talent. The four of them get to work at guessing Rumpelstiltskin's name. When the deadline is up, Rumpelstiltskin returns to see if Piggy has guessed his name and nearly gave it away. Upon recalling that Rumpelstiltskin went to summer camp Piggy has her father and the Loyal Royal Advisor grab him while stating to the King that \"a good mother always sews their child's name in their clothes before sending them off to camp.\" Piggy finds the label that lists Rumpelstiltskin's name and reads it out loud.

Robin the Frog doubts Rizzo's claim while another man stated that the Curative Elixir cured his baldness as a rat is seen on top of his head. Robin states that it is not hair, but a rat on the man's head which the man notices. Rizzo is arrested by the Police Chief and is taken to Emperor Fozzie Bear. Upon being brought to Emperor Fozzie, Rizzo claims to him that the rest of his wardrobe is shabby due to it not being special enough. Rizzo states that he happens to be the finest tailor in all the land. Emperor Fozzie then asks for Rizzo to make him some new clothes as Rizzo sends the Emperor to obtain gold for payment and to meet him in the Royal Dressing Room for a fitting. Rizzo has Yolanda take measurements in preparation for his new clothes while Montague weaves the finest fabric in all the land. Rizzo claims that the special fabric can only be seen by elegant people such as the Emperor. Emperor Fozzie then claims to be able to see the fabric in question. Members of the Emperor's Court claim to not see it until the Emperor claims that they are not \"elegant enough.\" The rats then present Fozzie with his new \"clothes\" that are on the hanger that Rizzo gives him. Before Rizzo can lead Yolanda and Montague to their next business in Tarzana, Emperor Fozzie states that he will hold a celebration to show off his new clothes with the rats being his guests of honor. At the celebration, Rizzo gives the crowd a heads up stating that Emperor Fozzie's new clothes can only be seen by the elegant. When Emperor Fozzie goes out to show his new clothes, Robin notices that Emperor Fozzie is wearing nothing but his boxers. Emperor Fozzie realizes that Robin is correct as the members of his Court end up using their bodies to cover him. The citizens of Fozzalia think that since Emperor Fozzie is not wearing clothing, then they should not either. Emperor Fozzie tells his people that they should stop doing things just because he does them, and that they should start thinking for themselves. As Rizzo, Yolanda, and Montague try to take their leave, they are caught by the Police Chief. Gonzo narrates that the Emperor and his kingdom learned that it is best to think for themselves and follow their own fashion. As for Rizzo, Yolanda, and Montague, they serve 10 years in the palace dungeon. When Rizzo states that after they get out they should visit a Sultan who is known to be gullible, Yolanda and Montague end up kicking Rizzo.\nSong: \"Nothing's Too Good for You\"\n\n\n=== The Elves and the Shoemaker ===\nA shoemaker (played by Kermit) and his nephew Robin are visited by the local banker who demands his money by tomorrow or he will toss them into the street. The shoemaker states that they have not been having good business lately since they have been making ugly shoes and all will be lost if they cannot sell any shoes. When the shoemaker and Robin go to sleep, their house is visited by a group of philanthropic entertainer elves (all dressed like Elvis Presley) and make blue suede shoes. The next morning, the shoemaker and Robin wake up to find the blue suede shoes and many customers waiting outside of their store. By the time night had fallen, every shoe in the shop has been sold and the banker takes the money stating that he will be back tomorrow for the other half of the money. When Robin hopes whoever helped them will return, the shoemaker states that they will be ready to find out who has been helping them. Once the shoemaker and his nephew have fallen asleep, they awoke in time to see the elves working on the blue suede shoes. When morning comes, the store is packed with eager customers and the banker takes the other half of the money. Having studied the look of the blue suede shoes, the shoemaker tells Robin he now knows how to make shoes that are not ugly, and that it is time they thanked the elves for their kindness. Rizzo ends up coming on stage to suggest a gift to give to the elves. The shoemaker and Robin worked through the night to make a special gift to thank the elves. When the elves arrived at midnight, the shoemaker and Robin present them with white sequined jumpsuits.

One day, while Hank and his local assistant Deke study a pod of grey whales swimming past the cove where they have set up camp, they witness a pair of fishermen, Joe Clausen and Burt, shooting at a passing group of killer whales. A female is fatally wounded and drifts into the cove, where she beaches and dies. Her mate remains near the carcass, mourning; Clausen and Burt insist on killing him, but Hank manages to send them off.\nHank seals off the cove with a net barrier strung across the entrance and then sets down to study the orca, who is dubbed \"Namu\" in the film's song. They are watched with distrust by the locals, except Kate Rand, the owner of the fishing gear store where Hank purchases his supplies, and her young daughter Lisa, who admires Hank's work. As Hank continues his observations, occasionally visited by the curious Lisa, Namu eventually overcomes his grief and begins playfully interacting with Hank. In time, Lisa leads some of the local children to the cove, and they throw food to Namu. One of the boys, Nick, viciously stuffs a hooked float into a piece of fish, making Namu go wild with pain when he swallows it.\nFollowing this incident, the townspeople march to the cove, fully armed, to kill Namu. Hank, however, soon discovers the cause for Namu's agony, and to prove that Namu is a peaceful creature, he dons swimming gear and enters the cove, followed by Kate when the fisherfolk still hesitate. The sight of the two swimming with Namu finally disperses their prejudice, but then Clausen, who has separated from the mob, opens fire from a boat beyond the net barrier. Hank has Deke open the net; Namu swims out and overturns Clausen's boat, but instead of killing him, he keeps Clausen afloat until Hank and Deke fish him out.\nOnce out in the open water, Namu encounters another group of orcas and joins them in swimming out into the sea.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRobert Lansing as Hank Donner\nJohn Anderson as Joe Clausen\nRobin Mattson as Lisa Rand\nRichard Erdman\tas Deke\nLee Meriwether\tas Kate Rand\nJoe Higgins as Burt\nMichael Shea as Nick\nClara Tarte as Carrie\nEdwin Rochelle\tas Charlie\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe fictional story was filmed on location in the San Juan Islands and at Rich Cove near Port Orchard, Washington.\nThe film 'starred' the orca Namu, one of the first orcas ever displayed in captivity.\n\n\n== Theme song ==\n\"The Ballad of Namu, the Killer Whale\", written and performed by Tom Glazer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1966\nOrca (also known as Orca: The Killer Whale), a 1977 film about a male orca getting revenge on a fisherman who accidentally killed his pregnant mate and their unborn calf.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNamu, the Killer Whale at IMDb\nNamu, the Killer Whale at the TCM Movie Database\nNamu, My Best Friend at AllMovie",

An email conversation follows.\nJack\u2019s sailboat has a problem in a cyclone and cannot return on the planned day, nor communicate with Nim. Galileo brings Jack things he needs to fix his ship as sharks begin to circle. Nim tells Alex her father has not returned as planned but she feels powerless to help, given that she can hardly even open her own door.\nThe island is visited by uncouth tourists who Nim believes to be pirates, as the name of their cruise liner is The Buccaneer. She attempts to make the island unattractive to them by catapulting lizards to shore, and by making a fire in the crater of the volcano and rolling boulders down the slopes to make it appear to be erupting. In so doing she inadvertently triggers an actual eruption. The tourists scramble for the boats. One of them, a boy, Edmund, sees and catches up with Nim. He is confused by her presence and she tells him she lives on the island. He tells the others, but no one believes him.\nMeanwhile, Alexandra's visions of her character Alex Rover help her to overcome her agoraphobia in order to travel to the island to rescue Nim. Nim, expecting \"Alex\" (the fictional male character), at first rejects Alexandra, but later relents and they share a meal.\nThe next day, Nim starts to cry, reasoning that if her ever-successful father were still alive he would be back already. Luckily, Jack reaches the island windsurfing on a makeshift catamaran. Jack and Alex meet and begin to get to know each other (Alex amazed at Jack being just as she imagined her fictional character). The film ends with everyone playing on the beach, using a coconut as a ball.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAbigail Breslin as Nim Rusoe\nJodie Foster as Alexandra \"Alex\" Rover\nGerard Butler as Jack Rusoe / Alex Rover\nAnthony Simcoe as First Mate\nAlphonso McAuley as Russell\nMorgan Griffin as Alice\nMichael Carman as Captain\nChristopher Baker as Ensign\nMaddison Joyce as Edmund\nPeter Callan as Edmund's Father\nRhonda Doyle as Edmund's Mother\n\n\n== Production ==\nShooting took place on Hinchinbrook Island, off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia over three weeks and ended in October 2007.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 53% of 106 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.7/10.

            "One Got Fat is a 1963 American short film about bicycle safety. It is written and directed by The Cowboys author Dale Jennings and narrated by F-Troop and Fractured Fairy Tales star Edward Everett Horton.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the film, ten children, nine of whom have monkey faces, hats and tails, plan on going to the park for a picnic. They all ride there on their eight bikes together on the nine-block journey (two did not have bikes; one's bicycle was stolen and who instead had to run to keep up with his friends, and the other was so obese that he broke his bicycle); seeing that one of their friends has a basket, they decide to have him carry all of their lunches to the park. Each one of the monkeys has a character flaw, and each disobeys a specific rule that prevents them from reaching the park. At each block, one of the monkeys is eliminated from the group because of the consequences of their disobedience\u2014usually by way of a collision. In the end, only one of the friends (who not only followed all the bike safety rules, but is also a normal human, whose face is not shown until the very end) makes it to the park and, because he was the one with the basket, and because \"he's no monkey\", gets all of his friends' food to himself, even though he doesn't want it all. Thus, as the title says, \"One got fat!\" Three of the monkeys are seen in hospital beds.\nIn contrast to other social guidance films, One Got Fat is a black comedy.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nEach character represents a different rule of the road the character does not obey, along with a more general sin or vice the character has that prevents him or her from doing so. (Four of the nine sins correspond to four of the seven deadly sins.)\n\nRooty-Toot (\"Rooty\") Jasperson\nMake Signals\nSin: Arrogance\nDemise: Turned left without stopping, signaling or looking, directly into ongoing traffic\nTinkerbell (\"Tink\") McDillinfiddy\nWatch Signs\nSin: Forgetfulness\nDemise: Ignores a stop sign, resulting in being hit by a large truck\nPhillip (\"Floog\") Floogle\nKeep Right\nSin: Boredom\nDemise: Rides on left side of street between parallel-parked cars and oncoming traffic; while doing so a car moves out, hitting him\nMossby Pomegranate\nLicense/Register\nSin: Sloth\nFate: Had his bicycle stolen before the trip and unsuccessfully tries to run along with the bicycles. Last seen on the curb, having given up from fallen arches. (While licensing and registration of bicycles was still available in the mid-20th century, the practice is now obsolete, and attempts to reintroduce bicycle registration in the 21st century have been soundly rejected. The film posits that had the bicycle been registered, police would have been able to find it and identify the thief more quickly.)\n\"Slim\" Jim Maguffny\nTrigby Phipps\nRide Alone\nSin: Gluttony (Slim), giving into peer pressure (Trigby)\nDemise: Because Slim overate himself to the point of obesity, his bicycle collapsed under his weight before the trip. Slim asks to ride on the front of Trigby Phipps's bicycle; because Slim blocks Trigby's view and makes it difficult for him to steer, Trigby veers right into an open manhole and both fall in\nNelbert (\"Nel\") Zwieback\nYield\nSin: Anger/wrath\nDemise: Nel's road rage prompts her to angrily switch to the sidewalk (something that was noted as being illegal in her jurisdiction) and refused to yield right of way to two oncoming pedestrians with groceries. The pedestrians were propelled into a nearby tree.\nFilbert (\"Fil\") Bagel\nTune Up\nSin: Neglect\nDemise: Fil assumes that he will be getting a new bike soon so he neglects his current bike. The brakes no longer work, resulting in Filbert being run over by a steam roller\nStanislaw (\"Stan\") Hickenbottom\nLights/Reflectors\nSin: Stupidity (\"not bright enough\")\nDemise: He rides his bike into a tunnel without any way to be seen. He collides with something in the tunnel, which cannot be seen due to the darkness\nOrville (\"Orv\") Slump\nFate: As he obeyed all of the traffic rules, he made it to the picnic, alone. Orv is revealed, unlike his friends, not to be a monkey. He is the one who \"got fat.\"\nThe actors include the children of director of photography Max Hutto (Dick and Colleen Hutto) and art director Ralph Hulett's wife and son (Shirley and Ralph Hulett, Jr.,) along with a number of their friends from school.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nAfter experiencing a mild revival of popularity on the Internet, the film was presented as a RiffTrax feature in April 2008, with commentary by Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy; they described the film as a \"concentrated dose of lab-purified nightmare fuel\" and said that it makes monkeys more terrifying than they already are. The film was also featured on Cracked, in the \"Worst Lessons PSAs Accidentally Taught Us\" episode of Michael Swaim's video show Does Not Compute, and again as number five of \"Five Most Excessively Creepy Children's Educational Videos\".\nFootage from the film is used in several music videos, such as \"Bloody Palms\" by Phantogram electronic rock band, \"Fool's Life\" by Dr. Dog, \"St. Peter\" by Black Spiders, \"January\" by Venetian Snares, \"Oh, Me; Oh, My\" by Nerf Herder, and \"Condotta, Condottiere\" by Mauk Tenieb. Since their 2011 Green Naugahyde tour, Primus has played clips of the film during performances of \"Here Come the Bastards.\" A few seconds of the film were also used in the video for Boney M's \"Rasputin\". A tribute to the original movie can be seen in the video for \"20 Inches of Monkey\" by The Lamps.\nClips were also featured in the \"Death\" episode of the Adult Swim series Off the Air. The film has probably reached its largest audience via its use in fan-made YouTube music videos for \"Everything You Do Is a Balloon\" by Boards of Canada and \"I'm the Devil\" by Clams Casino.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOne Got Fat at the Internet Archive\nOne Got Fat at IMDb\nOne Got Fat at the TCM Movie Database\nRifftrax version on official YouTube channel",

To their dismay, the girls are forbidden by Grandpa Edward to see the boys again.\nAt dinner one night, the girls challenge the French Foreign Minister, Monsieur De Beauvoir, and manage to convince him to accept an important proposal that was established by their grandfather, concerning clean drinking water for the Embassy. This puts Melanie and Allyson back in Grandpa Edward's good graces, and he allows them to once again see Jean and Michel, even allowing all four of them to attend a dance together where they have their first kisses.\nWhen the time comes for the girls to return home, Grandpa Edward decides to take a much-needed break from his ambassadorial duties and accompany them\u2014the intention being to spend time with his family (whom he hasn't seen for a long time) back in the United States.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPassport to Paris at IMDb\nPassport to Paris website",
            "Phantom of the Megaplex is a 2000 American comedy mystery film and Disney Channel original movie, produced by the Disney Channel. With a title and concept very loosely based on Gaston Leroux's 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera, the film concerns strange happenings at a monstrous megaplex on the night of the  premiere of a major movie, Midnight Mayhem.\nThe central character, played by Taylor Handley, is Pete Riley, the 17-year-old assistant manager of the theater. He has to cope with malfunctioning equipment, disappearing staff, and a broken popcorn machine, among other headaches. He investigates to see if the troubles are coincidence or the result of sabotage by a mysterious \"phantom\". The senior manager of the theater is played by Rich Hutchman, and Ricky Mabe, Julia Chantrey, Joanne Boland, J.J. Stocker, and Lisa Ng appear as other employees of the theater. Caitlin Wachs and Jacob Smith play the central character's younger siblings, and Heather and Jennifer Bertram appear as his love interest and her friend.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n17-year-old Pete Riley works as the assistant manager at the local 26-screen grand megaplex, a job that he loves and spends the majority of his time at. Rumor has it that the megaplex is haunted by a \"phantom\", someone who was trapped inside the old movie theater that was demolished to build the current megaplex. Pete, senior manager Shawn MacGibbon, the other employees, and an elderly member of the family who once owned the original theater known as \"Movie Mason\" (played by Mickey Rooney) who loves movies and thinks he works at the megaplex, are working to prepare the theater for the star-studded premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster Midnight Mayhem. Wolfgang Nedermayer, the owner of the megaplex, is to be among the guests. To Pete's disappointment, he is forced to bring along his younger siblings, 11-year-old Karen and 10-year-old Brian, to the theater while their widowed mother goes out on a date with her boyfriend George.\nPete dumps his siblings in a movie (which Karen ditches to see a horror movie with her friends) so he can focus on setting up for the premiere, but problems begin to pop up all through the megaplex. The other movies begin to suffer mishaps, which Karen and Brian realize are all related to the titles of the films being shown (for example, a theater showing a movie called Cyclone Summer has a giant fan moved in front of the screen, which blows everyone out of their seats). Pete, Karen, and Brian work together and discover that the rumored phantom is behind these acts of sabotage. Through online spoilers, Brian and Karen are able to learn the movie's plot, and Pete is able to stop the phantom from sabotaging the premiere. The phantom is revealed to be Shawn, who Nedermayer immediately fires and permanently bans; however, Shawn explodes with anger as he did all this so Nedermayer would finally notice him (and get his name right, since he never did). Shawn is then offered partnership by the director of Midnight Mayhem to make a movie based on his exploits\u2014Phantom of the Megaplex: The Shawn McGibbon Story.\nNedermayer offers Pete the job of senior manager at the megaplex, something Pete has always wanted. Though Pete tells Nedermayer that he'd be honored, he turns down the job. Inspired by Karen and Brian from their help exposing Shawn as the phantom, Pete realizes the importance of his childhood and doesn't want to waste it anymore, asking for the rest of the night off; Nedermayer complies, giving Pete money to treat his girlfriend Caitlin Kerrigan to a nice breakfast after the film. George proposes to Julie, as per suggested by Brian who said a 4\u2013star ending was needed to wrap things up. As everyone enters the movie theater, Movie Mason explains to Brian that he never once believed in the Phantom of the Megaplex; however, \"the Werewolf of the Megaplex is another story.\" Both enter the theater as an employee, \"Scary Terri\" (known for her horrifying stories), closes the doors as a wolf howl sounds.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nTaylor Handley as Pete Riley, 17-year-old assistant manager of the theater.\nCaitlin Wachs as Karen Riley, Pete's 11-year-old sister.\nJacob Smith as Brian Riley, Pete's perceptive 10-year-old brother.\nCorinne Bohrer as Julie Riley, Pete's widowed mother.\nJohn Novak as George, Julie's boyfriend.\nMickey Rooney as Mason / Movie Mason, elderly movie fan.

Since it is going to happen over the weekend, Polly has invited a new friend from England, her identical cousin Pia Pocket, who has dreams of being a rock star.\nAs the girls enjoy the hotel, Pia is told by her chaperone Miss Throckmorton she is not allowed to be in the rock band because anything American is not proper and ladylike, and she should stick to her British heritage. At the same time, Polly's father is held up at an airport in Iceland and Polly now has to present the dedication speech at the hotel opening in his place. Wanting to prove Miss Throckmorton wrong, the girls disguise Pia to look like Polly and teach her about all things American. The girls' plan goes into action with the cousins assuming the opposite's identity, which fools Miss Throckmorton completely. Meanwhile, Polly's jealous rival Beth is suspicious of Polly's sudden change in behavior, eventually meeting the cousins and seeing how identical they are, and plots to use their switch to ruin the ceremony which will be broadcast live.\nMiss Throckmorton overhears Beth talking about Pia and Polly's plan and thought Pia disobeyed her, and she runs into Polly, mistaking her for Pia, and grounds her to her hotel room. Pia is forced to take Polly's place at the ceremony with Polly reading her speech over the phone, but Miss Throckmorton catches her and hangs up. However, Pia manages to save the day by improvising with a speech of her own, causing Miss Throckmorton to realize the error of her ways; she apologizes to Polly for kidnapping her, makes amends with Pia, and allows her to pursue her dream of performing with the band.

            "Pollyanna is a 1960 American comedy-drama film starring child actress Hayley Mills, Jane Wyman, Karl Malden, and Richard Egan in a story about a cheerful orphan changing the outlook of a small town. The film was written and directed by David Swift, based on the 1913 novel Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter. The film won Hayley Mills an Academy Juvenile Award. It was the last film of actor Adolphe Menjou.\nPollyanna was Hayley Mills' first of six films for Disney, and the directorial debut of David Swift.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nPollyanna, a 12-year-old orphaned daughter of missionaries, arrives in the small town of Harrington to live with her rich and strict aunt Polly Harrington in the 1910s. Pollyanna is a very cheerful, talkative, and radically optimistic youngster who focuses on the goodness of life and always finds something to be glad about, no matter what the situation is. In doing so, Pollyanna's positive outlook on everything results in her making a wide variety of friends in the community, including the hypochondriac and grouchy Mrs. Snow and the acidic recluse Mr. Pendergast.\nAunt Polly's wealth controls most of the town. When the citizens want a derelict orphanage razed and rebuilt, Aunt Polly opposes the idea, arguing that her father donated the building to the town, and it is an important landmark as such. The townspeople defy her by planning a carnival to raise funds for a new structure. Because of the control that Aunt Polly asserts over every facet of the town, however, many people feel reluctant to show their support.\nA group of citizens led by Aunt Polly's ex-boyfriend Dr. Edmond Chilton tries to persuade the town's minister Rev. Ford to publicly declare his support for the bazaar by reminding him that \"nobody owns a church\". Rev. Ford is reminded of the truth of that statement when Pollyanna delivers a note from Aunt Polly with recommendations to his sermon content.  This lesson is reinforced when Pollyanna shows Ford a locket from her late father, inscribed with a quote from Abraham Lincoln reading, \"If you go around looking for the bad in people, you will surely find it.\"\n\nFirst, Rev. Ford reads one of the so-called \"Glad Passages\" of the Bible at church the following Sunday, stating that a young member of the congregation pointed out how many such passages there are, having gained the gumption to defy Aunt Polly. He intends to read one a week from this time on and then declares his support for the bazaar and encourages all to attend. Aunt Polly becomes furious about their audacity, forbidding Pollyanna to participate. On the evening of the carnival, Pollyanna is locked in her attic bedroom by Aunt Polly but is \"rescued\" by playmate and fellow orphan Jimmy Bean, who reminds her that she will lead \"America the Beautiful\" at the high point of the event. She slips away with Jimmy's help and has a wonderful time at the carnival, winning her first-ever doll.\nUpon returning home, Pollyanna avoids Aunt Polly by climbing a tree to her attic bedroom. When trying to reach her bedroom window, she drops her new doll; Pollyanna then falls off the window ledge screaming and is knocked unconscious before being discovered by Aunt Polly and her maids. \nAfter realizing her legs are paralyzed and that she may not ever walk again, Pollyanna develops severe depression, jeopardizing her chance of recovery. Meanwhile, Aunt Polly feels extreme guilt when she realizes how her behavior has isolated her from the town and Pollyanna. While talking to Dr. Chilton, she admits that her niece needed love and it was something she never gave her. Dr. Chilton tells Aunt Polly that they can give Pollyanna the love together and help mend the isolation she put on the townsfolk. \nWhen the townspeople learn of Pollyanna's accident, they arrive at Aunt Polly's house with outpourings of love. Dr. Chilton carries the reluctant girl downstairs where the neighbors wish her health one by one. Pollyanna's spirit gradually returns to its usual hopefulness and love of life, and she also learns that Jimmy has been adopted by Mr. Pendergast. Pollyanna is embraced by her aunt before they leave Harrington with Dr. Chilton for an operation in Baltimore which would correct her injury and help her walk again. She also found that the town adopted a nickname, Gladtown.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDirector David Swift cameos as a fireman in an early scene.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe novel had been filmed before, notably with Mary Pickford, in 1920. The book continued to sell 35,000 copies per year by the late 1950s. Disney announced in June 1959 that he would make the film with Hayley Mills, Jane Wyman, and Karl Malden, and David Swift as screenwriter and director.\nSwift was best known at the time for his work in television. He said: \"It was the first time anyone would take a $2.5 million chance on me. Trust Disney to do it.\"\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nDisney put Mills into the cast after seeing her in the British film Tiger Bay. He watched the film to see the most recent performance by her father, John Mills, who was to star in the studio's Swiss Family Robinson. Disney then offered Miss Mills the lead in Pollyanna. Her accent was explained by turning Pollyanna's parents into missionaries from the British West Indies.\nDisney said the cast was the most important in the studio's history, including names such as Wyman, Malden, and Richard Egan.\nSwift commented on casting: \"The cast scared me. Veterans of scores of movies, some of them. I was afraid they'd say 'TV man, go home'. But they didn't. It was a happy set; everybody worked his head off for me.\"\n\n\n=== Script ===\nSwift said in working on the script that, to work against the \"saccharine\" nature of the material, he would spend a few hours every day first working on a horror play called The Deadly. He would then work on Pollyanna.\nSwift said: \"In the book, Pollyanna was so filled with happiness and light that I wanted to kick her. In the old days, she came on like Betty Hutton. Now, she is shy. We have an adult drag advice out of her.\"\nSwift also decided to remove a key plot point of the book, where Pollyanna was hit by a car and had to learn how to walk. He called this \"Too coincidental. Too pat.\"\nSwift added that \"instead of making her the 'glad girl' of the book, we've simmered her cheerfulness down to merely emphasize the things-could-be-worse attitude.\"\n\n\n=== Shooting ===\nPollyanna began filming in August 1959.\nThe film was shot in Santa Rosa, California, with the Mableton Mansion at 1015 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa serving as the exterior and grounds of Aunt Polly's house. Other California locations included Napa Valley and Petaluma. Interiors were filmed at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The book sets the town of Harrington in Vermont, but the film places Harrington in Maryland; Baltimore is mentioned several times throughout the script. Aunt Polly and Pollyanna take the train to Baltimore at the end of the film, possibly headed to Johns Hopkins Hospital due to the delicacy of the operation needed (Johns Hopkins opened in 1889, and the story takes place in the 1900s).\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nDisney reported in 1960 that the film made a profit \"but not nearly what we expected\".\nJerry Griswold wrote in The New York Times on October 25, 1987: \"An attempt was made to resuscitate Pollyanna in 1960 when Walt Disney released a movie based on the book. Time, Newsweek, and other major reviewers agreed that such an enterprise promised to be a disaster \u2013 a tearjerker of a story presented by the master of schmaltz; what surprised the critics (their opinions were unanimous) was that it was his best live-action film ever. But few had reckoned the curse of the book's by-then-saccharine reputation. When the movie failed to bring in half of the $6 million that was expected, Disney opined, 'I think the picture would have done better with a different title. Girls and women went to it, but men tended to stay away because it sounded sweet and sticky'\".\nThe film has continued to be popular on television and home media. It is available to stream on Disney+.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nHayley Mills won the 1960 Academy Juvenile Award for her performance and also received a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.\n\n\n== Merchandise ==\n\nThe film generated a trickle of juvenile merchandise, including a Dell comic book, a paper-doll collection, an LP recording, an illustrated Little Golden Book, and a 30\" Uneeda character doll in a red and white gingham dress, pantaloons, and boots. Disney was selling photo lockets as part of a merchandise promotion, with the quote claiming to be from Abraham Lincoln on them: \"If you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it, you surely will\". Director and screenwriter David Swift discovered the necklace in a gift shop while on vacation with his family and called the studio to have the item recalled immediately, as it was not a quote from Lincoln, but actually a paraphrasing of a line from Eleanor Porter's original 1913 novel written for the film.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1960\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPollyanna at IMDb\nPollyanna at Rotten Tomatoes\nPollyanna at the TCM Movie Database",

            "Race to Witch Mountain is a 2009 American science fiction adventure thriller film directed by Andy Fickman. The film stars Dwayne Johnson alongside AnnaSophia Robb, Carla Gugino, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Alexander Ludwig, Tom Everett Scott, and Christopher Marquette. It is a reboot of the Witch Mountain franchise.\nJack Bruno, a Las Vegas taxi driver, must get extraterrestrials Seth and Sara to their spaceship on Witch Mountain before government agents and an assassin can catch up to them.\nRace to Witch Mountain was theatrically released on March 13, 2009, in the United States, through Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box-office success, grossing $106.4 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAn alien spacecraft crashes near Searchlight, Nevada, 45 miles outside of Las Vegas. Project Moon Dust, a secret Defense Department unit led by Henry Burke, reach the scene of the crash in black helicopters. Men in black seize the spaceship and search for its passengers to harness their DNA and powers.\nIn Vegas, former mob getaway driver Jack Bruno works as a taxi cab driver to avoid returning to jail. One of his passengers is failed astrophysicist Dr. Alex Friedman, who has come to Vegas to speak at a UFO convention at the Planet Hollywood hotel.\nAfter fending off two thugs who seek his services for mob boss Andrew Wolfe, Bruno finds two teenagers, Sara and Seth, in his cab. They offer $15,000 to drive them to an unknown destination. Burke's men track down the teenagers (who turn out to be the spaceship's passengers) through various discoveries such as stolen clothes, a car being burglarized, a bus heading to Las Vegas, and an ATM being deprived of all of its contents, which eventually pinpoints their location in Bruno's taxi. They engage Bruno in a chase. Mistaking the government agents for more mob thugs, he tries to evade them. Seth's ability to vary his molecular density, as well as Sara's telepathy and telekinesis, helps the group to escape.\nWhen they arrive at an abandoned house, Bruno follows them out of concern and curiosity. The teenagers retrieve the device they were looking for within a hidden underground laboratory, but the three are attacked by the \"Siphon\", an armored alien assassin. The Siphon pursues them until its spaceship crashes into a train and the creature is wounded.\nBruno brings Seth and Sara to Friedman at the UFO convention. Despite initially dismissing Bruno's story, she believes him after Seth and Sara show off their powers and narrate their current situation: they are aliens from a dying planet located 3,000 light years from Earth and can travel by using wormholes on their spaceships. Its government intends to invade Earth, despite the majority of their race being fully opposed to the plan, so that their kind may survive. Seth and Sara's parents are scientists who sought a way to save their planet without invasion, but were arrested before completing their experiment. The teenagers came to retrieve the successful results, but the alien government (who still plans on invading Earth rather than trying to save their home planet) sent the Siphon to stop them. To prevent the invasion from happening and save both worlds, they must retrieve their spaceship and return home with the results.\nRealizing that the teenagers are what she has been searching for, Friedman joins the group. They meet fellow UFOlogist and conspiracy theorist Dr. Donald Harlan, who reveals that the spaceship was taken to Witch Mountain, a secret US government base. Harlan and his men distract the soldiers with Bruno's taxi while the others escape to Witch Mountain in Harlan's RV after evading the Siphon. The group arrives at the base, but are captured by Burke. He orders that the teenagers be prepared for vivisection, but frees the adults, confident that nobody will believe them.\nThe Siphon attacks Witch Mountain and engages the soldiers, allowing Bruno and Friedman to infiltrate the base and free Seth and Sara. They launch the ship, escape through the mountain's tunnels, and kill the Siphon, who has stowed away on the spaceship. The teenagers give Bruno and Friedman a tracking device that will allow the aliens to always find them. They tearfully wish them farewell, but not before Sara gives her telepathic message to Bruno.\nWeeks later, Bruno and Friedman become successful authors of a book named Race to Witch Mountain: A True Story. They promote their book and knowledge on the UFO convention circuit, explaining that the publicity protects them from government reprisal. As they leave the convention, the alien device activates, implying that the alien teenagers may be returning to Earth.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDwayne Johnson as Jack Bruno, who is a Las Vegas cab driver and a former convict. The director wrote in a cab driver as a main character because there was a unique relationship between the driver and his passengers. Fickman explained: \"When Dwayne's driving and two aliens appear in his cab, he's stuck with them, there is an implied contract that I will get you to your destination, because that's what he does.\" This is Johnson's second Disney film, following the 2007 family comedy film The Game Plan, also directed by Andy Fickman.\nAnnaSophia Robb as Sara, sister of Seth, a girl with telekinetic and telepathic powers. Fickman chose Robb based on her performance as Leslie Burke in Bridge to Terabithia. She is kind to Bruno and is the more compassionate of the two siblings. The only time she does not refer to Jack by his full name (Jack Bruno) is when she says goodbye to him, when she refers to him only as \"Jack\".\nAlexander Ludwig as Seth, brother of Sara, a boy with the power to control his molecular density \u2013 \"phasing\" to become very dense, evidently giving him some degree of invulnerability, or become insubstantial and pass through solid objects. He is very cold to Bruno at first, not trusting him very much, but apologizes in the end saying that if it were not for him they would have not finished their mission. Both siblings talk using overly formal, emotionless, and analytical voices, and are always addressing Bruno by both his first and last name in all situations.\nCarla Gugino as Dr. Alex Friedman, a discredited astrophysicist. Fired from her university, she is relegated to giving a lecture at a UFO conference about hard science. She becomes Jack's love interest. Fickman was a fan of Gugino's role in the short-lived television series Threshold.\nCiar\u00e1n Hinds as Henry Burke, the leader of Project Moon Dust. Sarcastic and unscrupulous, he has no regard for morality, as demonstrated after Seth and Sara are imprisoned in Witch Mountain when he orders them to be experimented on so he can harness their powers, regardless of the possibility that they could die. As long as he gets results, whether they live or die does not matter to him. Hinds described his character as a man in black, explaining: \"I'm the head of the operation who's contacted directly by a man you never see...[It] is about protecting the country. He's responsible for it, and he'll do whatever needs to be done. That's how he sees it.\"\nTom Woodruff Jr. as The Siphon, a well-trained alien assassin.\nGarry Marshall as Dr. Donald Harlan, a friend of Alex's and author of UFO-related books, who thinks he can \"tell when people are lying to me\". He is seen tricking Burke into going after him by trading cars with Jack.\nTom Everett Scott as Mr. Matheson, a government agent working for Burke.\nCheech Marin as Eddie Cortez, the auto mechanic who gets frustrated when people come to his shop in the middle of the night, when it is closed.\nChris Marquette as Pope, one of Burke's agents.\nEva Huang as Shira the UFO Huntress\nBilly Brown as Mr. Carson\nDennis Hayden as Ray\nWilliam J. Birnes, the host of UFO Hunters, in a cameo.\nWhitley Strieber, author of Communion, in a cameo.\nKim Richards and Ike Eisenmann, who portrayed Tia and Tony in the original Witch Mountain films of the 1970s, made cameo appearances in Race to Witch Mountain. Richards appears as a roadhouse waitress (named \"Tina\", a minor change from the character [Tia] she played in the 1975 and 1978 films) and Eisenmann appears as Sheriff Anthony (a reference to his character [Tony] from the previous films). Meredith Salenger, the star of Disney's 1985 adventure The Journey of Natty Gann has a cameo as a TV reporter named \"Natalie Gann\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nDevelopment of an Escape to Witch Mountain remake was announced in April 2001, with writing duties handed to Adam Kulakow. In July 2007, Walt Disney Pictures hired Andy Fickman to direct Witch Mountain, a \"modern re-imagining\" of Escape to Witch Mountain, using a script by Matt Lopez. The following August, Dwayne Johnson (most notably famous for portraying The Rock in the WWE) was cast into a lead role, with filming scheduled to begin in March 2008. Fickman did not describe the film as a remake, defining his production as \"a new chapter within the world of Witch Mountain\". The director also described the book, the original source of the films, as \"a very cool dark thriller\" and anticipated drawing elements from it that did not exist in the 1975 film. By March 2008 filmmakers were using a new script written by Mark Bomback: now re-titled Race to Witch Mountain, filming began in Los Angeles the same month.\nThe convention center in Pomona, California was converted into the film's UFO Expo 9, and the interior of Witch Mountain was designed using photographs from a tour of NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain Complex. A cabin for the story was also built in Agua Dulce, California. The director sought assistance from UFO experts, the military, and CIA advisers to shape the elements of the film. He also introduced a new element in the remake, an extraterrestrial creature called Siphon. The creature was conceived by the design team who created the looks for Alien and Predator in the film Alien vs. Predator.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe Offspring song \"Stuff is Messed Up\" and Future World Music song \"Heart Of Fury\" were used in promos for the film. The score to Race to Witch Mountain was composed by Trevor Rabin, who recorded his score with a 78-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony and a 24-person choir at the Sony Scoring Stage. Two of the songs in the film were written and performed by country and western band Brokedown Cadillac, which appears briefly in an opening scene.\nThe film also features the hit single \"Fly on the Wall\" by Miley Cyrus and \"Emergency\" by Hollywood Records artist Steve Rushton, on the soundtrack.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nRace to Witch Mountain was released August 4, 2009 in three different sets: a single disc wide-screen DVD with no bonus features; a deluxe DVD edition with bonus content; and a Blu-ray release of the deluxe edition.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 42% rating based on 153 reviews, and an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Despite the best efforts of a talented cast, Race to Witch Mountain is a tepid reboot that lacks the magic of the original.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave it two and half stars on four.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film was a box office hit. It became the first Disney film in 2009 to open at #1, grossing $24.4 million. The film went on to gross over $67 million at the North American domestic box office, and over $39 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $106 million.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRace to Witch Mountain at IMDb\nRace to Witch Mountain at the TCM Movie Database\nRace to Witch Mountain at AllMovie",
            "Rascal is a 1969 American drama film made by Walt Disney Productions. The film is based on Sterling North's book of the same name which tells the story of young Sterling North and his \"ringtailed wonder\" pet raccoon, Rascal. Although set in 1918 Wisconsin, the movie was filmed in California.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the summer of 1918 in the little town of Brailsford Junction in central Wisconsin, Willard North takes his son, Sterling out into the woods, where a lynx surprises a family of raccoons, who run away, leaving a young raccoon behind. Sterling brings the raccoon home and names him Rascal. As Willard has to leave for work, his daughter, Theo, lines up interviews for a potential live-in housekeeper before returning to her job in Chicago. Willard agrees to meet with Theo's favorite, Mrs. Satterfield, but dismisses her afterwards, deciding that Sterling can take care of himself.\nDuring the summer Rascal starts causing trouble, including trashing up a local store and digging up a neighbor's corn patch. A local constable threatens to hold Sterling responsible for damages unless he keeps Rascal caged up. On his way home, Sterling takes Rascal to a race between a Stanley Steamer and a sulky. Rascal's presence inspires the sulky's horse, Donnybrook, to win the race, changing the town's opinion of him. Theo returns from Chicago, finding the home in a mess. Enraged, Theo confronts Willard, reminding him that Sterling is his son who needs help. Willard vows to become a better father to Sterling.\nLater that night, Rascal hears the mating call of a female raccoon through the window and tries to escape through Theo\u2019s room, waking her and everyone else. Following a scuffle where Rascal bites his finger, Sterling realizes it is time to let Rascal go. The next day, Sterling sets out in his homemade canoe and returns Rascal to his old stomping grounds, where he quickly locates a female racoon. But before Sterling leaves, the lynx returns. As he comes to help, Rascal and his new mate outwit the lynx, sending him tumbling into the water. Sterling leaves, knowing that the two will be able to protect each other.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBill Mumy as Sterling North\nWalter Pidgeon as adult Sterling North (voice)\nSteve Forrest as Willard North\nPamela Toll as Theo North\nElsa Lanchester as Mrs. Satterfield\nHenry Jones as Garth Shadwick\nBettye Ackerman as Miss Whalen\nJonathan Daly as Rev.

Theo is the only sibling featured in the film version.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe film features the song \"Summer Sweet\" by Bobby Russell.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRascal was the first film given a review in a publication by film critic Gene Siskel (later of Siskel and Ebert), appearing in the Chicago Tribune one month before he became the paper's official film critic in 1969. His review of the film was not favorable (\"Because of excessive gimmickry, most kids will miss the tenderness\", he wrote).\nHoward Thompson of The New York Times described the film as \"genteel, sweet-natured and appealingly frail\", but thought the story \"gets a little patly philosophical in trying to thrust practical responsibilities on the young hero, Bill Mumy, and his carefree, widowed father, Steve Forrest.\" Variety said that the film is a \"diverting adaptation of Sterling North book about a boy and his pet raccoon. Rascal will pull younger generation as well as family-groups in to see a clean, well-presented, unashamedly sentimental Disney film.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"for the young (and old) audience for which it is intended, Rascal is practically perfect hot weather fare, offering a spacious escape to a world of tree-shaded streets and spacious lawns, verandas, woods and ponds, trotting horses and Stanley Steamers (one at least).\" The Monthly Film Bulletin stated: \"Routine Disney boy-befriends-animal feature, agreeable enough on its own terms but as mawkishly sentimental as usual and with the additional embarrassment of a commentary by Walter Pidgeon which keeps insisting what a marvellous boyhood summer it all was.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1969\nAraiguma Rascal, a Japanese anime based on Rascal\n\n\n== References ==\n Text was copied from Disney Plus-Or-Minus: Rascal at Jahnke's Electric Theatre, which is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nRascal at IMDb\nRascal at the TCM Movie Database\nUltimate Disney DVD review\nRascal history site",

            "Rose Petal Place is an American-produced animated film from 1984 made by Ruby-Spears, with a corresponding line of flower-themed dolls made by Kenner Products. The concept for Rose Petal Place was created by David Kirschner and the film was written by Mal Marmorstein. The film was directed by Charles August Nichols, and was released in syndication in May 1984.\n\n\n== History ==\nRose Petal Place was first introduced in the 1980s as an animated film which also included a corresponding toy line and playsets. Rose Petal dolls were markedly similar to the fruit and dessert-themed Strawberry Shortcake dolls, also made by Kenner. The Rose Petal dolls themselves were flower-themed and based on different types of flowers.\nAccording to the toys' boxes and the movie, Rose Petal Place began a long time ago when a young girl (played by Nicole Eggert) was moving away from her lovely home and garden. She cried for her beloved garden because no one would be there to take care of her flowers. She didn't want them to perish, so she made a secret wish that the flowers would live forever. Out of this magical wish, combined with her tears of love, brought Rose Petal and all of her friends (Lily Fair, Daffodil, Orchid, Sunny Sunflower, and Iris) to life. Now living forever, Rose Petal and her friends reside in the garden and tend the little girl's flowers, but face trouble from the nefarious plots of Nastina the spider and her assistant Horace Fly.\nOther accessories which were produced included lunchboxes, books, games, stickers, and various fashions for the dolls.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThe primary characters of Rose Petal Place were:\n\nRose Petal, a pink-haired, pink-clad doll whose singing keeps the other flowers alive. In the cartoon, Rose Petal was voiced by Marie Osmond.\nSunny Sunflower, a yellow haired and clad tomboy who tells jokes to make the other flowers laugh. She is Rose Petal's closest companion. Voiced by Susan Blu.\nLily Fair, a blue haired and clad ballet dancer. Voiced by Renae Jacobs.\nDaffodil, another yellow haired and clad doll, this one obsessed with finance. Voiced by Susan Blu.\nOrchid, a purple clad shopaholic with pale lavender hair. Voiced by Renae Jacobs.\nIris, a purple and white clad painter of African ethnicity. Voiced by Candy Ann Brown.\nNastina, a widow spider who attempts to thwart the flowers' happiness, and even to kill Rose Petal on one occasion. Nastina is assisted by a horse-fly, Horace, (voiced by Frank Welker) who didn't get a toy. Voiced by Marilyn Schreffler.\nThe animated special also featured five other characters, Elmer, an Elm tree who watches over the garden, Seymour J. Snailsworth, a wise and helpful snail, P.D. Centipede, a sports-oriented centipede (all voiced by Frank Welker), Tumbles, a friendly hedgehog and a lavender-colored kitten named Pitterpat.\n\n\n== Rose Petal Place: Real Friends (1985) ==\nDavid Kirschner Productions and Ruby-Spears Enterprises created a second movie in 1985 called Rose Petal Place: Real Friends. The film was directed by Charles August Nichols. This second movie introduced six new characters, which Kenner scheduled to be released as dolls shortly after. Although prototypes and marketing samples were made, the entire line was discontinued before the dolls could hit the shelves.\n\n\n== The second series of unproduced dolls ==\nCherry Blossom, an Asian character wearing a cherry pink kimono. She enjoys interior decorating.\nSweet Violet, a light blue haired and clad actress.\nFuchsia, a dark purple haired doll with fuchsia clothing and a taste for clothing design.\nGladiola, a blonde doll with light pink clothes and a taste for tap dancing.\nMarigold, an orange haired and clad organizer of events.\nCanterbury Belle, a pink haired and clad baker.\n\n\n== Book and cassette episode list ==\nIn 1984, Parker Brothers put out a series of three books with accompanying cassette tapes, six books without cassettes, one Panorama book, and four coloring books, as well as the record.\n\n\n== A Concert at Carnation Hall ==\n\nAlso in 1984, Parker Brothers released an album with Marie Osmond reprising her role.\n\n\n== Track Listing ==\nSide 1\n\n\"Elmer's Song\" (Tom and Stephen Chapin)\n\"A Special Place\" (Tom and Stephen Chapin)\n\"Carnation Hall\" (John Forster)\n\"Nastina, The Beauty Queen (John Forster)\n\"Little Bit Of Love (John Carney and Tom Chapin)\nSide 2\n\n\"Rehearsal Song\" (Tom Chapin, Stephen Chapin and John Carney)\n\"Coral Bells\" (John Forster)\n\"Amazing\" (John Carney, John Forster, Stephen and Tom Chapin)\n\"Look Inside\" (John Forster)\n\"If You Have Love In Your Heart\" (John Carney)\n\n\n== Vocals ==\nRose Petal - Marie Osmond\nNastina - Evalyn Baron\nMale Character Voices - Russell Horton\nThe Flowers - Marina Belica, Victoria Blumenthal, Jessica Craven, Katie Irving, Merle Miller\nBackground - Stephen Chapin, Tom Chapin, The Suits\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nStephen Chapin - producer\nTom Chapin - producer\nFannie H.

            "The Rusty film series comprises eight American films produced for young audiences between 1945 and 1949 by Columbia Pictures. Child actor Ted Donaldson starred as Danny Mitchell in the series, which relates the adventures of a German Shepherd dog named Rusty. The role of Rusty was played by Ace the Wonder Dog in the first feature, Adventures of Rusty (1945). A police dog named Rip took over the role for the second film, The Return of Rusty (1946). In the later films Rusty was played by Flame, a charismatic dog star who was featured in three separate series.:\u200a176,\u200a193\u200a\nThe Rusty films were B-movies, primarily shown as the second half of a double bill. The basic boy-and-his-dog stories usually addressed social issues of the era, and provided civics lessons to its young audiences.\nDirectors at Columbia usually broke in with the studio's \"B\" features. Only William Castle and John Sturges advanced from the Rusty pictures to more ambitious projects; the series was usually entrusted to low-budget specialists Lew Landers or Seymour Friedman.\nAmong the regular cast members was child actor David Ackles, who appeared in most of the films as Danny's cohort Tuck. Character actor John Litel joined the series with the second film. Ann Doran, a longstanding member of Columbia's stock company, took over the role of Danny's mother in the third film, and remained in the role until the series ended in 1949. Ted Donaldson had outgrown the little-boy role by then; although the teenaged Donaldson remained with the series, much of the action in the final film, Rusty's Birthday (1949), was turned over to a new little boy, Jimmy Hunt.\n\n\n== Films ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",
            "Rusty's Birthday is a black-and-white American juvenile drama, released by Columbia Pictures in November 1949. Structured as an hour-long second feature, it is the final entry in the eight-film low-budget series which centers on the bond between the German Shepherd dog Rusty and the boy Danny Mitchell, portrayed by Ted Donaldson. Rusty's Birthday was directed by Seymour Friedman, and also stars John Litel (who played Danny's father in five of the eight films) and Ann Doran (who played Danny's mother in six films) as his parents, Hugh and Ethel Mitchell.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Rusty is lost and injured after performing a good deed ===\nRusty pulls the mailbox string, clamps his jaws around the letter inside and brings it into the kitchen where city legal official Hugh Mitchell is instructing his teenage son Danny on baking four rainbow trout. The burned fish wind up being offered to Rusty who also turns away from such a meal. Mrs. Mitchell returns from a trip to Chicago with a present for Rusty's upcoming birthday \u2014 a new collar. She also brings a pipe for Hugh and a briefcase for Danny who is about to start his junior year in high school. She also gives him a brochure for \"Rowan - Lee Military Academy / a College Preparatory School for Young Men\". Meanwhile, Rusty takes his other present, a small ball and exits into the backyard where he confronts a vagrant who then throws a wrench at him and runs to a gas station, just as a middle-aged woman drops her purse before getting into a car with her husband. As she realizes that the purse which, she tells him, contains her rings and nearly 200 dollars, is missing, Rusty is spotted running after the car to return it. As the grateful woman kisses Rusty, the vagrant who was following Rusty and the purse, steps out to claim that Rusty is his dog but, due to circumstances, would be willing to sell him. The woman gives him 25 dollars and asks the dog's name. The vagrant, already some distance away, shouts over his shoulder, \"Jackpot\".\nAttorney Mitchell telephones to place a newspaper ad regarding Rusty's disappearance, while Danny and his four friends from the neighborhood return after an unsuccessful search. Meanwhile, as the couple who \"bought\" Rusty stop their car, which is pulling a trailer, Rusty runs out of the trailer and starts for home. While searching for food in the harsh countryside, he injures his paw and becomes trapped in coiled wire. A young boy named Jeff Neeley, pulling a stuffed toy dog on a string, rescues Rusty, taking him to be the personification of his imaginary dog friend \"Gladly\" and leads him to the campsite where his older brother Bill and unemployed sharecropper father Virgil, sitting alongside a small dilapidated truck, are cooking food from their meager supply. The Neeleys determine that because Rusty, who has no license, is limping, with one paw held in the air, they will allow him to travel with them at least until he recovers.\n\n\n=== Rusty returns with a new family ===\nAs Danny and the four boys walk through town, they run into Miss Simmons, who runs the local employment agency and offers to add 5 dollars as her share of the reward offered for finding Rusty, just as Virgil approaches to ask her about job availability for a day laborer. Moments later, Danny and the boys spot Bill and Jeff who are sitting at the curb, next to the truck, examining Rusty's paw. During the confrontation, Jeff calls Rusty \"my dog\" and Danny retorts, \"in a pig's eye\u2026 stealing doesn't make him yours\". The next moment a motorcycle policeman arrives and takes the Neeleys, including Virgil, who has just returned from his job search, into the city's holding pen to confirm Virgil's lost registration paper for his truck. While his father and older brother are in brief detention, young Jeff is brought home for dinner by attending attorney Mitchell and, as the little boy tearfully reunites with his beloved \"Gladly\", Danny becomes jealous of the affection between Rusty and Jeff as well as the attention his own parents are lavishing on the boy, especially upon hearing the lullaby his mother was singing while putting Jeff to bed.\nThe next morning, Virgil arrives to pick up Jeff and start off on a new job search. Attorney Mitchell invites him for breakfast and presents the family an opportunity to farm a piece of property the Mitchells own nearby, while also offering to let Jeff continue to live in the house and start school. Carrie Simmons also arrives to tell Virgil that she found another job for him. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Danny tells his mother that he has decided to attend the military academy, after all.\nLater, as Bill is helping Virgil repair the cabin that will be their new living place, Miss Simmons arrives with a freshly baked pie. Bill resents \"all these women trying to run us\", but Virgil explains that his late mother said that \"you've got to know how to receive as well as how to give\". As Bill goes back to work, Virgil worriedly touches his stomach. Shortly thereafter, Bill hurriedly drives to the Mitchells' house and, with no one answering the front door, runs to the back, breaks a glass panel on the kitchen door and starts to gather ice from the freezer. Just then, Danny and his friends return, with Danny, egged on by his friends, accuses Bill of breaking in, and punches him, making Bill fall unconscious after hitting his head. As Mrs. Mitchell arrives, Bill revives and explains that his father had an appendicitis attack and needs emergency help. As calls are placed to the doctor and the hospital, everyone else leaves, but Danny remains in the house and sees a police car arrive holding the same vagrant who was chased away from the house by Rusty. Jack Wiggins, the gas station owner/attendant, explains to a gathering of locals that \"\u2026when I got back, I found this character looting the cash register\". The vagrant is brought into the Mitchell house where a confrontation with Rusty makes him blurt out that he didn't steal the dog, but only sold him.\n\n\n=== Danny regrets his uncharitable behavior ===\nUpon hearing the story, Danny goes with Rusty to the cabin and apologizes to Bill, explaining that it should have been obvious that Rusty would have never befriended thieves and that he should have trusted Rusty's instincts. He sits down and has a heart-to-heart talk with Bill about personal feelings and the meaning of home. He invites Bill to live with the Mitchells, but Bill says that he has to go the hospital to check on his father. They leave together with Rusty. Later, as the Mitchells discuss Danny's behavior, he returns home and tells them that \"Bill is a great guy\" and \"how wonderful it is to have a permanent address\". He goes upstairs and leaves Rusty in Jeff's room. Later that night, Bill arrives with the news that his father's appendix had burst and that he is calling for Jeff to be at his bedside. Running upstairs, Danny discovers that Jeff and Rusty are gone. The Mitchells leave for the hospital, while the two boys look for Jeff. It turns out that Jeff and Rusty went to the cabin to spend the night. In the morning, Miss Simmons arrives with warm cinnamon rolls. She tells Jeff that she also pretends, but in her case, that she has a little boy, just like him. He tells her that he dreams of his real mother singing to him, because his pretend mother can't sing. Miss Simmons then cuddles him in her lap and sings to him \"Beautiful Dreamer\". Danny and Bill arrive at the cabin and tell Miss Simmons that Virgil is very ill. Jeff awakens and thinks that Danny came to take \"Gladly\" away, but Danny tells him that \"Gladly\" is now Jeff's dog. Later, Bill returns with the happy news that their father is better and Jeff, looking at Miss Simmons, tell him that \"she can sing just like everything\".\n\n\n=== Rusty's offspring becomes the new \"Gladly\" ===\nAs the Mitchells came home from the hospital with the news that Virgil Neeley is out of danger, Danny offers to give up Rusty so that Jeff can have his \"Gladly\" and live with the Mitchells while he is at military school, his parents tell him that there is no need for any of that, since Jeff will be happy with his father and Miss Simmons, to whom \"he's transferred his heart\u2026 lock, stock and barrel\". Also, news from the local farm is that Rusty is a father again and one of his pups will make a perfect new \"Gladly\" for Jeff. It all ends with a birthday party for Rusty as Jeff hugs his new little Gladly and Mrs. Mitchell cuts Rusty's birthday cake.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Taglines ==\n\"RUSTY TAKES THE CAKE for his most heart-warming adventure!\"\n\"More troubles than even a dog can solve!\"\n\n\n== Regular showings on Turner Classic Movies ==\nAfter premiering Rusty's Birthday on June 30, 2007, Turner Classic Movies has continued to present it, along with the other films in the series, at least once a year, as part of its Saturday morning schedule of series films as well as serials.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRusty's Birthday at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nRusty's Birthday at IMDb\nRusty's Birthday at the TCM Movie Database\nRusty's Birthday at AllMovie\nRusty's Birthday at TV Guide\nRusty's Birthday at Popcorn Time",

            "Santa Claus: The Movie (titled onscreen simply as Santa Claus) is a 1985 British-American Christmas film starring Dudley Moore, John Lithgow, and David Huddleston. It depicts the origin of Santa Claus (played by Huddleston), and his modern-day adventure to save one of his elves (Moore) who has been manipulated by an unscrupulous toy company executive (Lithgow). It was directed by Jeannot Szwarc and was the last major fantasy film produced by the Paris-based father-and-son production team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind.\nReleased in North America by TriStar Pictures on November 27, 1985, Santa Claus: The Movie flopped at the box office and received negative reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the Middle Ages, a woodcutter named Claus delivers hand-carved toys to the children of his village each Christmas, accompanied by his wife Anya and their reindeer Donner and Blitzen. Upon leaving, they are caught in a blizzard and succumb to the cold. They are magically transported to the North Pole and resurrected, and they encounter the resident elves with their magical workshop. Lead elf Dooley explains that their coming was prophesied; that it is Claus' destiny to deliver the toys made by the elves to the children of the world; and that they, like the elves, will live forever. The following Christmas Eve, the oldest elf dubs Claus \"Santa Claus\" and explains that the night will last as long as it takes for him to deliver toys to every child on Earth. Donner and Blitzen join six other reindeer and are fed hay sprinkled with magical powder that enables them to fly, pulling Santa's sleigh through the air. As the centuries pass, much of the mythology and traditions surrounding Santa Claus develop.\nBy the late 20th century Santa is exhausted by his ever-growing workload, and Anya suggests that he enlist an assistant. Two elves compete for the position: Puffy, who follows traditional toymaking methods, and Patch, who has many ideas for modernization. Patch wins by designing a machine to increase production through automation, but unbeknownst to him it begins to malfunction and produce shoddy toys. In New York City Santa befriends homeless orphan boy Joe and takes him for a ride in his sleigh. They unsuccessfully attempt the \"Super Duper Looper\", a vertical loop maneuver which always fails due to Donner's acrophobia. They also meet wealthy orphan girl Cornelia, who befriends Joe.\nWhen the toys produced by Patch's machine fall apart on Christmas Day, he resigns in disgrace and leaves the North Pole, winding up in New York City. Meanwhile, the B.Z. Toy Company, run by Cornelia's unscrupulous step-uncle B.Z., is facing shutdown by the government for producing unsafe toys. Seeing the company's toys being pulled from a storefront, Patch mistakenly thinks they are very popular and approaches B.Z. about a job. Hoping to redeem himself in Santa's eyes, he creates lollipops laced with the magic powder that allows the reindeer to fly, and a flying car which he uses to deliver them to the world's children on Christmas Eve. The lollipops allow people to fly, making them an instant sensation and leaving Santa feeling obsolete and disheartened. B.Z. convinces Patch to strengthen the formula and put it in candy canes, planning to launch his own holiday on March 25 called \"Christmas 2\".\nCornelia and Joe overhear B.Z. plotting to oust Santa as the figurehead of Christmas, and Joe is kidnapped. Cornelia further overhears B.Z.'s assistant, Towzer, share his discovery that the candy canes explode when exposed to extreme heat. B.Z. plans to take Towzer and their money and flee to Brazil, letting Patch take the fall for their dangerous product. Cornelia writes to Santa, who rushes to help despite two of his reindeer being sidelined by illness. Patch finds Joe bound and gagged in the toy factory basement and frees him. Seeing a wood carving resembling Patch that Santa made for Joe, Patch realizes that Santa misses him. He and Joe take off for the North Pole in his flying car with the candy canes loaded in the trunk, unaware that they are becoming unstable. Santa and Cornelia pursue in Santa's sleigh; as the car explodes, they successfully perform the Super Duper Looper, saving Joe and Patch. The police, alerted by Cornelia, have arrested Towzer and B.Z.'s other henchman Grizzard, and attempt to arrest B.Z. too, but he eats several of the magic candy canes and jumps out a window, only to float upward uncontrollably into space.\nSanta agrees to let Joe and Cornelia live at his workshop, and they celebrate with the elves.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDudley Moore as Patch\nJohn Lithgow as B.Z.\nDavid Huddleston as Claus/Santa Claus\nBurgess Meredith as the Ancient Elf\nJudy Cornwell as Anya\nJeffrey Kramer as Towzer\nChristian L. Fitzpatrick as Joe\nCarrie Kei Heim as Cornelia\nJohn Barrard as Dooley\nAnthony O'Donnell as Puffy\nAim\u00e9e Delamain as a storyteller in Claus' village\nDorothea Phillips as Miss Tucker, Cornelia's nanny\nJohn Hallam as Grizzard, B.Z.'s chauffeur\nJudith Morse as Miss Abruzzi, who works for B.Z.\nJerry Harte as a Senate Chairman\nIan Wise as Salvation Army Bandsman (Central Park scene)\nAdditional elves were played by Melvyn Hayes, Don Estelle, Tim Stern, Peter O'Farrell and Christopher Ryan, as Goober, Groot, Boog, Honka, Vout and Goobler respectively. Other minor roles were played by Paul Aspland, Sally Granfield and Michael Drew as reporters; Walter Goodman as a street corner Santa; John Cassady as a wino; and Ronald Fernee and Michael Ross as policemen.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nConceived by Ilya Salkind in the wake of the apparently waning critical and U.S. box office success of 1983's Superman III and its immediate follow-up, 1984's Supergirl, Santa Claus: The Movie was directed by Supergirl director Jeannot Szwarc, from a story by David and Leslie Newman (though David Newman took sole screenplay credit). Pierre Spengler, Ilya's longtime partner and a longtime collaborator of the Salkinds', joined Ilya as the project's producer.\nJohn Carpenter was originally offered the chance to direct, but also wanted a say in the writing, musical score, and final cut of the film. Carpenter's original choice for the role of Santa was Brian Dennehy. Szwarc, however, felt that he needed an actor with more warmth than Dennehy. Lewis Gilbert was another early choice for director but, despite initial interest, he could not agree with the Salkinds over certain aspects of the script. Robert Wise was also offered the chance to direct, but had a different approach to the story. Guy Hamilton, who'd had to withdraw from directing Superman: The Movie in 1976, lobbied hard for the chance to direct the film, but only on the condition that it be shot either in Los Angeles, Vancouver, or Rome. Ultimately, the Salkinds chose Szwarc because of their excellent working relationship on Supergirl.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nDudley Moore was the Salkinds' top choice to play the lead elf in the film, Ilya Salkind having remembered a scene in Arthur in which Liza Minnelli's character asks Moore if he is Santa's Little Helper. Moore was attached to the project early on, and had a say in both scripting and choice of director. David Newman's first script draft named Moore's character Ollie, but Moore decided that the name should be changed to Patch, which was the nickname of his young son, Patrick. Moore had briefly been considered to play the role of Mister Mxyzptlk in the Salkinds' aborted original script for Superman III, and for the role of Nigel in Supergirl. He turned down that role, but suggested his longtime friend and comic partner Peter Cook for the part.\nIlya Salkind wanted an American actor to portray Santa Claus because he felt that the film focused on a primary piece of Americana in much the same way that Superman: The Movie had. Szwarc screen-tested such actors as David White (who, being in his late 60s, was considered too old for the role) and Moore's Arthur co-star Barney Martin. For a while, Ilya Salkind actively pursued Carroll O'Connor for the role before Szwarc showed him David Huddleston's screen-test, which won Salkind over.\nFor the role of B.Z., the producers wanted a star with a similar stature to Gene Hackman when he had played Lex Luthor in Superman: The Movie. To this end, they offered the role to Harrison Ford who turned them down. They made offers to Dustin Hoffman, Burt Reynolds and Johnny Carson, each of whom also turned the part down. Eventually, John Lithgow was settled on after Ilya Salkind watched Terms of Endearment and realized that he had a Grinch-type look to him.\nThe role of the Ancient Elf was written with James Cagney in mind. Though he liked the film's overall idea, Cagney, at 84, turned the role down due to being too weakened by age to perform it. Fred Astaire was considered, but when this eventually came to nothing Dudley Moore suggested his friend Burgess Meredith for the role, which he in the end won. At the time of the film's announcement in mid-1983, the British Press carried reports that diminutive actors such as David Jason, Patrick Troughton and Norman Wisdom would be cast alongside Moore as fellow elves, but none of them were.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nSanta Claus: The Movie was filmed in Buckinghamshire, England at Pinewood Studios, between August and November 1984. The film was photographed by Arthur Ibbetson, whose credits included Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971). Santa Claus: The Movie was his final feature film. Serving as film editor was Peter Hollywood. The production was designed by Anthony Pratt, with costume design concepts by Bob Ringwood. The visual effects unit, as well as several of the production staff, were Salkind stalwarts from the Superman films: Derek Meddings, director of visual and miniature effects; Roy Field, optical visual effects supervisor; and David Lane, flying and second unit director.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSanta Claus: The Movie received negative reviews upon release, with a rating of 22% on Rotten Tomatoes, from the 23 reviews counted. Box Office Mojo lists the film's total United States box office gross as $23,717,291, less than its $30\u201350 million production budget. It was very popular in the UK, grossing \u00a35,073,000.\nChicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert noted some positive points to the film, writing that the film \"does an interesting job of visualizing Santa's workshop\" and Santa's elves. He also praised the film's special effects, particularly the New York City fly-over sequence involving Santa. Ebert also had some praise for Lithgow's \"nice, hateful performance\", but wrote that \"the villain is not drawn big enough\". He ceded that young children would probably like most of the film, but that older children and adults are \"likely to find a lot of it a little thin\".\nVincent Canby of The New York Times was less positive than Ebert, calling the production \"elaborate and tacky\". He described the film as having \"the manner of a listless musical without any production numbers\". Unlike Ebert, he offered little praise for the film's production design. Canby quipped that \"Santa's workshop must be the world's largest purchaser of low-grade plywood\" and that the flyover sequences with Santa \"aren't great\". The only praise he had for the film's acting was for John Lithgow, who Canby wrote \"(gave) the film's only remotely stylish performance\". A more recent review by William Mager for the BBC echoed Canby and Ebert's comments.\nIn his book Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas, critic Alonso Duralde lists Santa Claus: The Movie in his chapter of worst Christmas films ever. His reasons include weak plot, garish production design, blatant product placement (particularly for McDonald's, though Coke and Pabst Blue Ribbon are also prominent), and scenery-chewing overacting on the part of Lithgow. Duralde ultimately concludes that the film is \"a train-wreck of a Christmas film that's so very wrong that you won't be able to tear yourself away from it\".\nJohn Lithgow, in a 2019 interview, said that Santa Claus was \"one of the tackiest movies I've ever been in. It seemed cheesy and it certainly never stuck...except in England. It is huge over there. I wish I had a nickel for every Englishman who's told me [it's their favorite film]. In England, that's half of what I'm known for\".\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nThe soundtrack score was composed and conducted by Henry Mancini, composer of the themes from The Pink Panther and Peter Gunn, with veteran lyricist and screenwriter Leslie Bricusse contributing five original songs. The song \"It's Christmas (All Over the World)\" was written by Bill House and John Hobbs with Freddie Mercury in mind. While it is known that Mercury recorded a demo for the House/Hobbs song at Pinewood Studios, he was never to make a full commitment to the project, as he and his Queen bandmates had already committed themselves to the Highlander soundtrack. In the end, Mercury turned down the project, stating that he felt that Queen had become overcrowded with requests to work on film soundtracks; as a result, Sheena Easton was ultimately chosen to record the tune. As mentioned on the DVD commentary of the film by Jeannot Szwarc, Paul McCartney was asked to compose songs for the film. It is unknown why he did not do so in the end.\n\nTrack listing\n\"Main Title: Every Christmas Eve 1 and Santa's Theme (Giving)\" (Mancini/Bricusse)\n\"Arrival of the Elves\" (Mancini)\n\"Making Toys\" (Mancini/Bricusse)2\n\"Christmas Rhapsody: Deck the Halls/Joy to the World/Hark!

Soon after, it went out of print and remained unavailable until 2009 when it was released on CD as a limited run of 1000 copies which sold out immediately upon release. This production suffered from several issues, most notably a master which had been subjected to heavy noise reduction resulting in a loss of sound quality. Additionally, the left & right channels had been erroneously flipped, a superficial re-edit had been performed on \"It's Christmas (All Over the World)\", and the song \"Shouldn't Do That\" by Kaja (Kajagoogoo) had been omitted due to licensing issues. In 2012 a deluxe three-disc set, including remastered tracks, outtakes and alternate versions and a 32-page booklet, was released.\n\n\n== Comic book adaptation ==\nMarvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Sid Jacobson and artist Frank Springer in Marvel Super Special #39.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSanta Claus in film\nList of Christmas films\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSanta Claus: The Movie at IMDb\nSanta Claus: The Movie at AllMovie\nSanta Claus: The Movie at Box Office Mojo\nSanta Claus: The Movie at Rotten Tomatoes",

            "The Magdeburg Centuries is an ecclesiastical history, divided into thirteen centuries, covering thirteen hundred years, ending in 1298; it was first published from 1559 to 1574. It was compiled by several Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg, known as the Centuriators of Magdeburg. The chief of the Centuriators was Matthias Flacius. Lutheran theologian Werner Elert argued that due to its revolutionary critical method of presenting history, it is the basis of all modern church history. It is said that Baronius undertook his Annales Ecclesiastici purely to oppose the Magdeburg Centuriators.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe Magdeburg Centuries demonstrates the continuity of the Christian faith throughout the ages. As the Centuries put it, Church history shows a \"perpetual agreement in the teaching of each article of faith in all ages\". Instead of presenting a Restorationist platform, the writers held that  \"this very form of the teaching which we now have in our churches because of the great kindness of God is that very ancient one, not a new one; genuine, not adulterous; true, not fabricated.\" The view of the work is generally pessimistic after the fifth century, in keeping with the writers' objective of presenting \"the origins and the increments of errors and their corrupting influences.\" \nPresenting a view of such corrupting errors by the Catholic Church, increasing and accumulating over a thousand years' time, served to legitimize the Reformation and make Lutherans rather than Catholics into the true heirs of the original Christianity founded by Jesus Christ and his disciples. Another characteristic of the work is the widespread use of primary sources rather than secondary or tertiary ones. In order to accomplish this, scholars traveled and borrowed manuscripts from all over Europe. With such diverse sources, one might expect a fractured or incoherent presentation of history. Instead, it provides a perspective that is completely independent from any of its sources, even though they are as wide-ranging as Gregory of Nazianzus and Alcuin.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nNot only are the volumes artificially divided by century rather than by historical eras, but each century is treated from a similar perspective, rather than from a fresh perspective for every era of history. Catholics have dissented from controversial historical arguments in the Centuries, made to discredit the papacy, including the identification of the pope as the Anti-Christ, and the legend of Pope Joan.\n\n\n== Full title ==\nThe full title of the work is Ecclesiastica Historia, integram Ecclesiae Christi ideam, quantum ad Locum, Propagationem, Persecutionem, Tranquillitatem, Doctrinam, H\u00e6reses, Ceremonias, Gubernationem, Schismata, Synodos, Personas, Miracula, Martyria, Religiones extra Ecclesiam, & statum Imperii politicum attinet, secundum singulas Centurias, perspicuo ordine complectens: singulari diligentia & fide ex vetustissimis & optimis historicis, patribus, & aliis scriptoribus congesta: Per aliquot studiosos & pios viros in urbe Magdeburgic\u00e2.\n\n\n== Origin and composition ==\nThe first three folio volumes of the work appeared in 1559 at Basel. It was the work of a group of Lutheran scholars who had gathered at Magdeburg, and who are now known to history as the Centuriators of Magdeburg because of the way in which they divided their work (century by century) and the place in which the first five volumes were written; most of the others were written at Wismar or elsewhere, but the subtitle in Urbe Magdeburgic\u00e2 was retained.\nThe originator of the idea and the moving spirit of the organization which produced the work was Matthias Vlacich (Latinized Flacius), also known as Francovich, and, from the country of his birth (Istria), Illyricus. Born in 1520, he went to university in 1539 in Switzerland and Germany, where, at Augsburg, Basle, T\u00fcbingen, and Wittenberg, he converted to Lutheranism. The Augsburg Interim of 1548 led to the Adiaphoristic controversy, in the course of which he wrote numerous harsh criticisms of the Reformer Philipp Melanchthon; the bitter feeling generated gave rise to the hostile parties of Philippists and Flacians. All attempts to restore peace failed, and the University of Jena, where Flacius was appointed professor of theology in 1557, became a centre of rigid Lutheranism in strong opposition to Melachthon. His wanderings after 1562, and the numerous domestic controversies between the Reformers, in which Flacius took part until his death (11 March 1575), did not prevent him from becoming the most learned Lutheran theologian of his day, while, in addition to numerous minor controversial works, his untiring energy led him to devise the vast historical work known as \"The Centuries\".\nAfter Martin Luther's death in 1546, anti-Catholic controversy tended to lose its dogmatic character and to become historical. Flacius critiqued the history of Catholicism, and in that spirit wrote his once famous and influential catalogue of anti-papal witnesses, Catalogus testium veritatis, qui ante nostram aetatem reclamarunt Papae (Basel, 1556; enlarged ed., Strasburg, 1562; ed. by Dietericus, Frankfort, 1672). Some four hundred anti-papal witnesses were cited, Pope Gregory I and Thomas Aquinas being included in the number of those who had stood up for truth against \"the Papal Antichrist\".\nAs early as 1553, Flacius was seeking patrons whose financial support should enable him to carry out his plan of a comprehensive church history which was \"to reveal the beginnings, the development and the ruthless designs of the Antichrist.\" The German princes, and the burghers particularly of Augsburg and Nuremberg, helped him generously, but no support was forthcoming from the followers of Melanchthon. He travelled through Germany in search of material while his co-worker, Marcus Wagner (from Weimar near Gotha), searched the libraries of Austria, Bavaria, Scotland, and Denmark for the same purpose.\nResearch has emphasized the importance of the assistance given by the crypto-Protestant, Caspar von Nydbruck, imperial counselor, and head of the Imperial Library of Vienna, whose influence was exerted throughout Europe on behalf of the work. The editorial board, Gubernatores et Inspectores institut histori\u00e6 Ecclesiastic\u00e6, was composed of Flacius, John Wigand (1523\u20131587), superintendent at Magdeburg, Matthew Judex (1528\u20131576), preacher at Magdeburg, Basil Faber (1525\u20131576), humanist, who collaborated in the first four Centuries, Martin Copusgas, a physician who acted as treasurer, and Eblinek Alman, a burgher of Magdeburg, each of whom had his own assistants. Seven junior assistants were appointed to compile extracts from early Christian writers and historians in accordance with a fixed plan; two more mature scholars acted as \"architects\", grouped the material, and submitted it to the editors. When approved, the materials were worked up into chapters and again submitted before the final form was fair-copied.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nAn analysis of the Quarta Centuria, (Fourth Century) which appeared in 1560, will give an idea of the contents:\n\nTitle page\ndedication to Queen Elizabeth (co. 3\u201312)\nbrief statement of the chief events of the century (col.13)\nspread of the Church: where and how (13\u201335)\npersecution and peace of the Church under Diocletian and Maximian (35\u2013159)\nthe Church's teaching and its history (160\u2013312)\nheresies (312\u2013406)\nrites and ceremonies (406 -483)\nChurch discipline and government (483\u2013582)\nschisms and controversies (583\u2013609)\ncouncils (609\u2013880)\nleading bishops and doctors (880\u20131337)\nleading heretics (1338\u20131403)\nthe martyrs (1403\u20131432)\nmiracles and miraculous occurrences (1433\u20131456)\npolitical relations of the Jews (1456\u20131462)\nother non-Christian religions (1462\u20131560)\npolitical changes (1560\u20131574)\nScriptural index (8 cols.)\ngeneral index (92 pages of four columns)\nThis method was applied only to the first thirteen centuries, which were published separately in folio volumes at Basel; I\u2013III in 1559 (reprinted 1560, 1562, 1564); IV in 1560 (reprinted 1562); V and VI in 1562; VII and VIII in 1564; IX in 1565; X and XI in 1567; XII in 1569; and XIII in 1574. The three remaining centuries were completed in manuscript by Wigand (who was largely responsible for all the work done between 1564\u201374), but never published, and the various attempts made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to continue the work came to naught. In 1624, a complete edition of the Centuries in six folio volumes was issued at Basel by Louis Lucius, who omitted the authors' names and dedications, and introduced various modifications of the text in a Calvinistic sense. A third edition appeared at Nuremberg 1757\u20131765, but did not get beyond the fifth century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLatin edition of 1757, HathiTrust Digital Library\nBaudouin, Flacius, and the Plan for the Magdeburg Centuries\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

            "The Book of Discipline refers to two works regulative of ecclesiastical order in the Church of Scotland, known as The First Book of Discipline (1560) and The Second Book of Discipline (1578), drawn up and printed in the Scottish Reformation. The first was drafted by a committee of \"six Johns\", including leading reformer  John Knox. It set out a system of Presbyterian polity on the Geneva model, but the lack of funds meant its programme of clerical organisation and education was largely abandoned. The second book was adopted after the forced abdication of Mary Queen of Scots and was much more clearly Presbyterian in outlook. It placed church supervision fully in the hands of groups of elected church leaders in presbyteries.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1560, following the death of the regent Mary of Guise, who ruled on behalf of her daughter Mary, Queen of Scots who was in France and the defeat of French forces at the Siege of Leith, the reform-minded Lords of the Congregation were in the ascendency in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament met in Edinburgh 1 August 1560. Ignoring the provisions of the Treaty of Edinburgh, on 17 August, Parliament approved a Reformed Confession of Faith (the Scots Confession), and on 24 August it passed three acts of Parliament that abolished the old faith in Scotland. Under these, all previous acts not in conformity with the Reformed Confession were annulled; the sacraments were reduced to two (Baptism and Communion) to be performed by reformed preachers alone; the celebration of the Mass was made punishable by a series of penalties (ultimately death) and Papal jurisdiction in Scotland was repudiated. The Queen declined to endorse the acts that Parliament had passed and the new kirk existed in a state of legal uncertainty.\n\n\n== First Book of Discipline ==\nThe Lords had intended for the parliament to consider a Book of Reformation, that they had commissioned and which was largely the work of John Knox. However, they were unhappy with the document and established a committee of \"six Johns\", including Knox, John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Willock, John Douglas and John Row, to produce a revised version.  While Knox, Spottiswood and Willock were long committed Protestants, Windram, Douglas and Row had until recently been pillars of the Catholic establishment and the composition of the committee may have been intended as a compromise. However, the members worked well together and produced a radical plan for church reform. The result of the delay was that the document, known as the First Book of Discipline was not considered by the full parliament, but a thinly attended convention of nobles and about 30 lairds, in January 1561 and then only approved individually and not collectively.\nThe book set out a system of church order that included superintendents, ministers, doctors, elders and deacons. It also contained a programme of parish-based reformation that would use the resources of the old church to pay a network of ministers, a parish based school system, university education and arrangements for poor relief. However, the proposal for the use of church wealth were rejected and under an Act of Council, which kept two-thirds in the hands of its existing owners and even the remaining third had to be shared with the Crown. The result was an abandonment of the educational programme, ministers remained poorly paid and the church was underfunded.\n\n\n== Second Book of Discipline ==\nIn July 1567, Mary was forced to abdicate in favour of her 13-month-old son James VI. James was to be brought up a Protestant and the government was to be run by a series of regents, beginning with James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, until James began to assert his independence in 1581. Mary eventually escaped and attempted to regain the throne by force. After her defeat at the Battle of Langside in May 1568, by forces loyal to the King's Party, led by Moray, she took refuge in England, leaving her son in their hands. In Scotland the King's Party fought a civil war on behalf of the king against his mother's supporters, which ended, after English intervention, with the surrender of Edinburgh Castle in May 1573. In 1578 a Second Book of Discipline was adopted, which was much more clearly Presbyterian in outlook. It placed church supervision fully in the hands of groups of elected church leaders, in presbyteries, synods and the general assembly.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe full text of the First and Second Books of Discipline at the Wayback Machine (archived 14 November 2019)",

It was commissioned by Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow from Ivan the Terrible's personal confessor, Andrew, in 1560. This vast work of codification recast historical data compiled from medieval Russian chronicles so as to suit Ivan's tastes and ambitions in the wake of his coronation as the first Russian tsar.\nThe book gave shape to the idea of Moscow being the \"third Rome\" by tracing Ivan's patrilineal descent not only from Rurik, but from the first Roman emperor, Augustus. This fantasy genealogy was borrowed from the earlier Tale of the Princes of Vladimir. The compilation is subdivided into 17 parts, or degrees (hence the title). Each degree corresponds to a generation of Ivan's royal ancestors.\nAccording to Arthur Voice, the book \"glorifies to the utmost the historic past and the present of Muscovite Rus, primarily by extolling the rulers as having acted in full accord with the church\". The biographies of Kievan, Vladimirian and Muscovite rulers tend to pass over into hagiography. Each monarch is presented as a saint, and his actions are cast as \"holy deeds\". The political philosophy of the time tends to be obscured by thick layers of bombast and rhetoric.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLenhoff, G.; Kleimola, A., eds. (2011).

            "The Geneva Bible is one of the most historically significant translations of the Bible into English, preceding the Douay Rheims Bible by 22 years, and the King James Version by 51 years. It was the primary Bible of 16th-century English Protestantism and was used by William Shakespeare, Oliver Cromwell, John Knox, John Donne and others. It was one of the Bibles taken to America on the Mayflower (Pilgrim Hall Museum has collected several Bibles of Mayflower passengers), and its frontispiece inspired Benjamin Franklin's design for the first Great Seal of the United States.\nThe Geneva Bible was used by many English Dissenters, and it was still respected by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the time of the English Civil War, in the booklet The Souldiers Pocket Bible.\nBecause the language of the Geneva Bible was more forceful and vigorous, most readers strongly preferred this version to the Great Bible. In the words of Cleland Boyd McAfee, \"it drove the Great Bible off the field by sheer power of excellence\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Geneva Bible followed the Great Bible of 1539, the first authorized Bible in English, which was the authorized Bible of the Church of England.\nDuring the reign of Mary I (1553\u20131558), who restored Catholicism and outlawed Protestantism in England, a number of English Protestant scholars fled to Geneva, which was then a republic in which John Calvin and, later, Theodore Beza, provided the primary spiritual and theological leadership. Among these scholars was William Whittingham who supervised the translation now known as the Geneva Bible, in collaboration with Myles Coverdale, Christopher Goodman, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson, and William Cole.  Whittingham was directly responsible for the New Testament, which was complete and published in 1557, while Gilby oversaw the Old Testament. Several members of this group would later become prominent figures in the Vestments controversy.\n\nThe first full edition of this Bible, which included a revised New Testament, appeared in 1560, and was published by Sir Rowland Hill of Soulton, but it was not printed in England until 1575 (New Testament) and 1576 (complete Bible). Over 150 editions were issued; the last probably in 1644. The first Bible printed in Scotland was a Geneva Bible, which was first issued in 1579. In fact, the involvement of Knox (1514\u20131572) and Calvin (1509\u20131564) in the creation of the Geneva Bible made it especially appealing in Scotland, where in 1579 a law was passed requiring every household of sufficient means to buy a copy.\nSome editions from 1576 onwards included Laurence Tomson's revisions of the New Testament. Some editions from 1599 onwards used a new \"Junius\" version of the Book of Revelation, in which the notes were translated from a new Latin commentary by Franciscus Junius. \nThe annotations, a significant part of the Geneva Bible, were Calvinist and Puritan in character, and as such were disliked by the ruling pro-government Anglicans of the Church of England, as well as by James I, who commissioned the \"Authorized Version\", or King James Bible, in order to replace it. The Geneva Bible had also motivated the earlier production of the Bishops' Bible under Elizabeth I for the same reason, and the later Rheims\u2013Douai edition by the Catholic community. The Geneva Bible nevertheless remained popular among Puritans and was in widespread use until after the English Civil War. The last edition was printed in 1644.\nThe Geneva notes were surprisingly included in a few editions of the King James Version, as late as 1715. Benjamin Franklin is understood to have been inspired by the frontispiece of the Geneva Bible in his design proposal for the first Great Seal of the United States.\n\n\n== Translation and format ==\nThe Geneva Bible was the first English version to be translated entirely from the original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Though the text is principally just a revision of William Tyndale's earlier work of 1534, Tyndale had only fully translated the New Testament; he had translated the Old Testament through 2 Chronicles before he was imprisoned. The English refugees living in Geneva completed the first translation of the Old Testament from Hebrew to English. The work was led by William Whittingham.\n\n\n=== Textual basis ===\nThe Geneva Bible was translated from scholarly editions of the Greek New Testament and the Hebrew Scriptures that comprise the Old Testament. The English rendering was substantially based on the earlier translations by William Tyndale and Myles Coverdale (the Geneva Bible relies significantly upon Tyndale).\n\n\n=== Format ===\n\n\n==== Size ====\n\nThe Geneva Bible was also issued in more convenient and affordable sizes than earlier versions. The 1560 Bible was in quarto format (218 \u00d7 139 mm type area), but pocket-size octavo editions were also issued, and a few large folio editions. The New Testament was issued at various times in sizes from quarto down to 32\u00ba (the smallest, 70\u00d739 mm type area).\n\n\n== Breeches Bible ==\nHere are both the Geneva, Tyndale and the King James versions of Genesis 3:7 with original spelling (not modernized):\n\n\n== King James I and the Geneva Bible ==\n\nKing James I's distaste for the Geneva Bible was not caused by the translation of the text into English, but rather the annotations in the margins. He felt strongly that many of the annotations were \"very partial, untrue, seditious, and savoring too much of dangerous and traitorous conceits\". In all likelihood, he saw the Geneva's interpretations of some biblical passages as anti-clerical \"republicanism\", which could imply church hierarchy was unnecessary. Other passages appeared particularly seditious, most notably references to monarchs as \"tyrants\".\nExamples of the commentary in conflict with the monarchy in the Geneva Bible (modern spelling) include:\n\nDaniel 6:22 \u2013 \"For he [Daniel] disobeyed the king\u2019s wicked commandment in order to obey God, and so he did no injury to the king, who ought to command nothing by which God would be dishonoured.\"\nDaniel 11:36 \u2013 \"So long the tyrants will prevail as God has appointed to punish his people: but he shows that it is but for a time.\"\nExodus 1:19 \u2013 To the Hebrew midwives lying to their leaders, \"Their disobedience herein was lawful, but their dissembling evil.\"\n2 Chronicles 15:15-17 \u2013 King Asa \"showed that he lacked zeal, for she should have died both by the covenant and by the law of God, but he gave place to foolish pity and would also seem after a sort to satisfy the law.\"\nWhen toward the end of the conference two Puritans suggested that a new translation of the Bible be produced to better unify the Anglican Church in England and Scotland, James embraced the idea. He would not only be rid of those inconvenient annotations but have greater influence on the translation of the Bible as a whole. He commissioned and chartered a new translation of the Bible which would eventually become the most famous version of the Bible in the history of the English language. Officially known as the Authorized Version to be read in churches, the new Bible would come to bear his name as the so-called King James Bible or King James Version (KJV) elsewhere or casually. The first and early editions of the King James Bible from 1611 and the first few decades thereafter lack annotations, unlike nearly all editions of the Geneva Bible up until that time. \n\nInitially, the King James Version did not sell well and competed with the Geneva Bible. Shortly after the first edition of the KJV, King James banned the printing of new editions of the Geneva Bible to further entrench his version. However, Robert Barker continued to print Geneva Bibles even after the ban, placing the spurious date of 1599 on new copies of Genevas which were actually printed between about 1616 and 1625.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nAlthough the King James Version was intended to replace the Geneva Bible, the King James translators relied heavily upon this version. Bruce Metzger, in Theology Today 1960, observes the inevitable reliance the KJV had on the Geneva Bible. Some estimate that twenty percent of the former came directly from the latter. He further revels in the enormous impact the Geneva Bible had on Protestantism: \"In short, it was chiefly owing to the dissemination of copies of the Geneva version of 1560 that a sturdy and articulate Protestantism was created in Britain, a Protestantism which made a permanent impact upon Anglo-American culture.\"\nThe Puritan Separatists or Pilgrim Fathers aboard the Mayflower in 1620 brought to North America copies of the Geneva Bible. German historian Leopold von Ranke observed that \"Calvin was virtually the founder of America.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTyndale Bible (1526)\nCoverdale Bible (1535)\nMatthew Bible (1537)\nTaverner's Bible (1539)\nGreat Bible (1539)\nBishops' Bible (1568)\nDouay\u2013Rheims Bible (1582)\nKing James Bible (1611)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nText\nScanned copy of the original 1560 Geneva Bible\nGeneva Bible (1599)\nGeneva Bible Footnotes\nGeneva Bible online (1599)\nModern Spelling Geneva Bible with Footnotes for the Gospels\nWorks by or about Geneva Bible at the Internet Archive\nArticles\nThe Geneva Bible of 1560 Archived 28 October 2005 at the Wayback Machine: article by Bruce Metzger originally printed in Theology Today\nOnline version of Sir Frederic G.

            "The Magdeburg Centuries is an ecclesiastical history, divided into thirteen centuries, covering thirteen hundred years, ending in 1298; it was first published from 1559 to 1574. It was compiled by several Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg, known as the Centuriators of Magdeburg. The chief of the Centuriators was Matthias Flacius. Lutheran theologian Werner Elert argued that due to its revolutionary critical method of presenting history, it is the basis of all modern church history. It is said that Baronius undertook his Annales Ecclesiastici purely to oppose the Magdeburg Centuriators.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe Magdeburg Centuries demonstrates the continuity of the Christian faith throughout the ages. As the Centuries put it, Church history shows a \"perpetual agreement in the teaching of each article of faith in all ages\". Instead of presenting a Restorationist platform, the writers held that  \"this very form of the teaching which we now have in our churches because of the great kindness of God is that very ancient one, not a new one; genuine, not adulterous; true, not fabricated.\" The view of the work is generally pessimistic after the fifth century, in keeping with the writers' objective of presenting \"the origins and the increments of errors and their corrupting influences.\" \nPresenting a view of such corrupting errors by the Catholic Church, increasing and accumulating over a thousand years' time, served to legitimize the Reformation and make Lutherans rather than Catholics into the true heirs of the original Christianity founded by Jesus Christ and his disciples. Another characteristic of the work is the widespread use of primary sources rather than secondary or tertiary ones. In order to accomplish this, scholars traveled and borrowed manuscripts from all over Europe. With such diverse sources, one might expect a fractured or incoherent presentation of history. Instead, it provides a perspective that is completely independent from any of its sources, even though they are as wide-ranging as Gregory of Nazianzus and Alcuin.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nNot only are the volumes artificially divided by century rather than by historical eras, but each century is treated from a similar perspective, rather than from a fresh perspective for every era of history. Catholics have dissented from controversial historical arguments in the Centuries, made to discredit the papacy, including the identification of the pope as the Anti-Christ, and the legend of Pope Joan.\n\n\n== Full title ==\nThe full title of the work is Ecclesiastica Historia, integram Ecclesiae Christi ideam, quantum ad Locum, Propagationem, Persecutionem, Tranquillitatem, Doctrinam, H\u00e6reses, Ceremonias, Gubernationem, Schismata, Synodos, Personas, Miracula, Martyria, Religiones extra Ecclesiam, & statum Imperii politicum attinet, secundum singulas Centurias, perspicuo ordine complectens: singulari diligentia & fide ex vetustissimis & optimis historicis, patribus, & aliis scriptoribus congesta: Per aliquot studiosos & pios viros in urbe Magdeburgic\u00e2.\n\n\n== Origin and composition ==\nThe first three folio volumes of the work appeared in 1559 at Basel. It was the work of a group of Lutheran scholars who had gathered at Magdeburg, and who are now known to history as the Centuriators of Magdeburg because of the way in which they divided their work (century by century) and the place in which the first five volumes were written; most of the others were written at Wismar or elsewhere, but the subtitle in Urbe Magdeburgic\u00e2 was retained.\nThe originator of the idea and the moving spirit of the organization which produced the work was Matthias Vlacich (Latinized Flacius), also known as Francovich, and, from the country of his birth (Istria), Illyricus. Born in 1520, he went to university in 1539 in Switzerland and Germany, where, at Augsburg, Basle, T\u00fcbingen, and Wittenberg, he converted to Lutheranism. The Augsburg Interim of 1548 led to the Adiaphoristic controversy, in the course of which he wrote numerous harsh criticisms of the Reformer Philipp Melanchthon; the bitter feeling generated gave rise to the hostile parties of Philippists and Flacians. All attempts to restore peace failed, and the University of Jena, where Flacius was appointed professor of theology in 1557, became a centre of rigid Lutheranism in strong opposition to Melachthon. His wanderings after 1562, and the numerous domestic controversies between the Reformers, in which Flacius took part until his death (11 March 1575), did not prevent him from becoming the most learned Lutheran theologian of his day, while, in addition to numerous minor controversial works, his untiring energy led him to devise the vast historical work known as \"The Centuries\".\nAfter Martin Luther's death in 1546, anti-Catholic controversy tended to lose its dogmatic character and to become historical. Flacius critiqued the history of Catholicism, and in that spirit wrote his once famous and influential catalogue of anti-papal witnesses, Catalogus testium veritatis, qui ante nostram aetatem reclamarunt Papae (Basel, 1556; enlarged ed., Strasburg, 1562; ed. by Dietericus, Frankfort, 1672). Some four hundred anti-papal witnesses were cited, Pope Gregory I and Thomas Aquinas being included in the number of those who had stood up for truth against \"the Papal Antichrist\".\nAs early as 1553, Flacius was seeking patrons whose financial support should enable him to carry out his plan of a comprehensive church history which was \"to reveal the beginnings, the development and the ruthless designs of the Antichrist.\" The German princes, and the burghers particularly of Augsburg and Nuremberg, helped him generously, but no support was forthcoming from the followers of Melanchthon. He travelled through Germany in search of material while his co-worker, Marcus Wagner (from Weimar near Gotha), searched the libraries of Austria, Bavaria, Scotland, and Denmark for the same purpose.\nResearch has emphasized the importance of the assistance given by the crypto-Protestant, Caspar von Nydbruck, imperial counselor, and head of the Imperial Library of Vienna, whose influence was exerted throughout Europe on behalf of the work. The editorial board, Gubernatores et Inspectores institut histori\u00e6 Ecclesiastic\u00e6, was composed of Flacius, John Wigand (1523\u20131587), superintendent at Magdeburg, Matthew Judex (1528\u20131576), preacher at Magdeburg, Basil Faber (1525\u20131576), humanist, who collaborated in the first four Centuries, Martin Copusgas, a physician who acted as treasurer, and Eblinek Alman, a burgher of Magdeburg, each of whom had his own assistants. Seven junior assistants were appointed to compile extracts from early Christian writers and historians in accordance with a fixed plan; two more mature scholars acted as \"architects\", grouped the material, and submitted it to the editors. When approved, the materials were worked up into chapters and again submitted before the final form was fair-copied.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nAn analysis of the Quarta Centuria, (Fourth Century) which appeared in 1560, will give an idea of the contents:\n\nTitle page\ndedication to Queen Elizabeth (co. 3\u201312)\nbrief statement of the chief events of the century (col.13)\nspread of the Church: where and how (13\u201335)\npersecution and peace of the Church under Diocletian and Maximian (35\u2013159)\nthe Church's teaching and its history (160\u2013312)\nheresies (312\u2013406)\nrites and ceremonies (406 -483)\nChurch discipline and government (483\u2013582)\nschisms and controversies (583\u2013609)\ncouncils (609\u2013880)\nleading bishops and doctors (880\u20131337)\nleading heretics (1338\u20131403)\nthe martyrs (1403\u20131432)\nmiracles and miraculous occurrences (1433\u20131456)\npolitical relations of the Jews (1456\u20131462)\nother non-Christian religions (1462\u20131560)\npolitical changes (1560\u20131574)\nScriptural index (8 cols.)\ngeneral index (92 pages of four columns)\nThis method was applied only to the first thirteen centuries, which were published separately in folio volumes at Basel; I\u2013III in 1559 (reprinted 1560, 1562, 1564); IV in 1560 (reprinted 1562); V and VI in 1562; VII and VIII in 1564; IX in 1565; X and XI in 1567; XII in 1569; and XIII in 1574. The three remaining centuries were completed in manuscript by Wigand (who was largely responsible for all the work done between 1564\u201374), but never published, and the various attempts made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to continue the work came to naught. In 1624, a complete edition of the Centuries in six folio volumes was issued at Basel by Louis Lucius, who omitted the authors' names and dedications, and introduced various modifications of the text in a Calvinistic sense. A third edition appeared at Nuremberg 1757\u20131765, but did not get beyond the fifth century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLatin edition of 1757, HathiTrust Digital Library\nBaudouin, Flacius, and the Plan for the Magdeburg Centuries\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

            "The Scots Confession (also called the Scots Confession of 1560) is a Confession of Faith written in 1560 by six leaders of the Protestant Reformation in Scotland. The text of the Confession was the first subordinate standard for the Protestant church in Scotland. Along with the Book of Discipline and the Book of Common Order, this is considered to be a formational document for the Church of Scotland during the time.\nIn August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland agreed to reform the religion of the country. To enable them to decide what the Reformed Faith was to be, they set John Knox as the superintendent over John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Willock, John Douglas, and John Row, to prepare a Confession of Faith. This they did in four days. The 25 Chapters of the Confession spell out a contemporary statement of the Christian faith as understood by the followers of John Calvin during his lifetime. Although the Confession and its accompanying documents were the product of the joint effort of the Six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to John Knox.\nWhile the Parliament approved the Confession on 27 August 1560, acting outside the terms of the Treaty of Edinburgh to do so, Mary, Queen of Scots, a Roman Catholic, refused to agree, and the Confession was not approved by the monarch until 1567, after Mary's overthrow. It remained the Confession of the Church of Scotland until it was superseded by the Westminster Confession of Faith on 27 August 1647. However, the confession itself begins by stating that the Parliament \"ratifeit and apprevit [the confession] as wholesome and sound doctrine grounded upon the infallible truth of God's word\"; thus, though changes within societies may have diminished its relevance, believers hold that the authority of its statements is rooted not in parliamentary approval but in, as it says, \"the infallible truth of God's word\".\nIn 1967, it was included in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.'s Book of Confessions alongside various other confessional standards, and remains in the current Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s Book of Confessions.\n\nAs the Confession of Faith Ratification Act 1560, the Confession remains part of Scots law.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCochrane, Arthur (2003), \"The Scottish Confesion of Faith\", Reformed Confessions of the Sixteenth Century, Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, ISBN 978-0-664-22694-7, retrieved 5 February 2013\nGonz\u00e1lez, Justo (1984), \"The Reformation in Great Britain\", The Story of Christianity, vol. 2, Peabody: Prince Press, ISBN 978-1-56563-522-7, retrieved 30 January 2013\nGray, John (June 1939), \"The Political Theory of John Knox\", Church History, 8 (2), Cambridge University Press: 132\u2013147, doi:10.2307/3160651, ISSN 0009-6407, JSTOR 3160651, S2CID 162564925\nHorton, Michael (21 December 2011), \"Glossary\", The Christian Faith: A Systematic Theology for Pilgrims on the Way, Grand Rapids: Zondervan, p. 1000, ISBN 978-0-310-40918-2, retrieved 26 November 2012"

            "Acts and Epistles of the Apostles (the \"Apostle\"), completed in 1564, is the first Russian printed publication that has an exact date. It was published by Ivan Fyodorov (\u0418\u0432\u0430\u0301\u043d \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432).\nIt includes a short history of the origins of the first Moscow state printing house, written by the printer. The work on the \"Apostle\" began on 19 April 1563 and finished on 1 March 1564.\nIt was published at the Moscow Print Yard and written in the liturgical language of the Russian Orthodox Church. Ivan Fyodorov (circa 1510-83) was one of the first printers in the East Slavic region, publishing liturgical works using movable type. The Apostle was widely used by the Orthodox Church and about 120 copies are known to exist, of which five are in the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nActs and Epistles of the Apostles (1564) in The European Library 1st image",
            "Anatomes totius is a book written in 1564 by Andr\u00e9 V\u00e9sale and Jacques Gr\u00e9vin.\nIn the years after the 1543 publication of De humani corporis fabrica, the physician Andr\u00e9 V\u00e9sale was confronted with a high number of imitators and plagiarizers. It was a groundbreaking work on anatomy, over 700 pages long and filled with illustrations.\n\n\n== Derived works ==\nIn the same year as the original publication, Vesalius published a shorter version or abridgement of this work, which featured many illustrations of the original. It was dedicated to Philip II of Spain.\nTwo years after the 1543 publication, Thomas Geminus (the pseudonym of Thomas Lambrit) printed another abridgment: the Compendiosi totius Anatomiae delineatio. An English translation of this work would appear in 1553 and 1559. Geminus took many of the illustrations from the Fabrica, but unlike the original, printed them on separate sheets. This is caused by the fact that Geminus decided to use copper intaglio plates rather than woodcuts as in the original. Geminus was an engraver and may have done the illustrations. Because of this, the relation between text and images is less clear and many images are gathered on a single sheet without any relation.\nHis copper plates were sold or lent to Parisian printer Andr\u00e9 Wechel who also prepared two editions, a Latin one in 1564 and a French edition in 1569. The Latin edition appeared under the title Anatomes totius aere insculpta delineatio. In 1565 he printed a second edition.\nThe illustrations are also on separate plates. One of the most remarkable plates is an illustration of Adam and Eve at the beginning of the book. The book is somewhat between an abstract and a compendium. Because of the high number of plates, it was more accessible to the non-specialist.\nMany of the illustrations were simplified versions of Vesalius's original work. The remarkable landscapes behind the dissected bodies, once so prominent, disappeared. The watermarks of the first Wechel edition (1654) may have been from London. That would most likely mean that the sheets were printed in London and transported to Paris. However, the second edition also contains this watermark of a gauntlet and a star. The precise details remain unknown. One possibility is that Geminus sold the printed sheets instead of the plates.\n\n\n== References ==",
            "The Ausbund (\"Paragon\" in German) is the oldest Anabaptist hymnal and one of the oldest Christian song books in continuous use. It is used today by North American Amish congregations.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe core of the Ausbund is based on fifty-one songs written by Anabaptists from Passau,Bavaria. Eleven of these songs were written by their leader, Michael Schneider. Twelve others may have been written by Hans Betz. The hymns were composed in the dungeon of Passau Castle, where the Anabaptists were imprisoned between 1535 and 1540 because of their convictions. Some\u2014among them Hans Betz\u2014did not survive the imprisonment.  Many of these imprisoned Anabaptists were martyred.\nThe collection was printed in 1564. A copy of this first printing is found at the Mennonite Historical Library of Goshen College, bearing the title Etliche sch\u00f6ne christliche Ges\u00e4ng wie dieselbigen zu Passau von den Schweizer Br\u00fcdern in der Gefenknus im Schloss durch g\u00f6ttliche Gnade gedicht und gesungen warden. Ps. 139 (Several Beautiful Christian Songs Which Were Written and Sung Through God's Grace by the Swiss Brethren in the Passau Castle Prison).\nThe printed hymnal must have been widely circulated. By the Frankenthaler Colloquiums (1571) it was already used as a source of criticism by opponents of Anabaptism.\nAnother edition of the hymnal with eighty more songs appeared in 1583.  This is the first edition where the word Ausbund appears on the title page: Ausbund. Das ist etliche sch\u00f6ne christenliche Lieder, etc. Allen und jeden Christen, welcher Religion sie seien, unpartheyisch n\u00fctzlich.\nLater editions included 137 (Europe) and 140 (North America) songs. In all there are eleven known European editions of the Ausbund. In the 16th and 17th centuries the hymnals were published in Cologne and the Rhineland. In the 18th and 19th centuries new editions appeared in Basel und Strasbourg. The last European edition was printed in Basel in 1838. The first American Ausbund appeared in 1742 and was printed at Christopher Saur's Germantown press. Mennonite Bishop Henry Funck was the publisher of this hymnal, which was used until the end of the 18th century by the Swiss Mennonite churches. It was replaced by Die kleine geistliche Harfe and Unpartheyisches Gesangbuch of 1804, both from Pennsylvania.\nThe Ausbund is now exclusively used in Amish worship, preserving the unique spirit of the 17th-century Anabaptists. A number of the hymns have been translated into English both in book reference form and also set to music as found in the Christian Hymnary where it is used in many Conservative Mennonite worship services.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe oldest songs from the Ausbund are mainly about the suffering church in a hostile environment. At the center stand those serious Christians who are prepared to die for their faith. They reflect not only grief and despair, but also the understanding of God's presence. There are always more reasons to thank God as one pours out their troubles. Among others, song number 131, O Gott, Vater, wir loben dich und deine G\u00fcte preisen wir (O God, Father, we praise you and your kindness we praise), today is sung at beginning of each Amish worship service.\n\n\n== Content ==\nThe first song of the Ausbund is from the pen of Sebastian Franck. The song teaches that Christians should sing in spirit and truth, pray and praise God with Psalms. The second song is an adaptation of the Athanasian Creed.\nSongs 6, 7 and 8 are written by Felix Manz, Michael Sattler and Hans Hut, all Anabaptist martyrs. Other martyr songs are by Leonhard Schiemer, Hans Schlaffer, George Blaurock and Hans Leupold, who were among the victims of the first great persecution of Anabaptists.\nHans B\u00fcchl, participant in the Frankenthaler Colloquiums, is the writer of five Ausbund songs. Eleven songs are of Dutch origin. The Dutch Anabaptists wrote another eleven songs. Five songs are from the Bohemian Brothers.\nMany of Ausbund songs have a teaching character: Bible lessons, the Anabaptist views on believers baptism, the Lord's Supper and a focus on eschatology. Songs in this last topic include B\u00fcchl's (Nr. 46): Ain new christelich Lied von der gegenwardig schr\u00f6cklichen letzten Dagen, in welchen so vil verschieden secten, auffr\u00fchrerisch und falsche Propheten erschainen, auch blutdirstige tyrannen (A new Christian song from the current terrible last days, in which many different sects, rebellious and false prophets and bloodthirsty tyrants appear).\nUntil 1809 the European Ausbund was distributed with no indication of location or publisher. From 1692 the government of Bern forbade the distribution or possession of this hymnal and ordered its confiscation under threat of severe punishment.\nThe American edition contains the confession of faith of Thomas von Imbroich (1558) entitled Wahrhaftigen Bericht \u00fcber die gro\u00dfe Tr\u00fcbsal, die die Geschwister rund um Z\u00fcrich f\u00fcr ihre Glaubenssache zwischen 1635 und 1645 zu erleiden hatten (a collection of martyr stories).\nFrom a literary viewpoint the content of the Ausbund is of limited quality, yet witnesses of a deep religious belief and sacrificial devotion of the believers.\n\n\n== Music ==\nThe Ausbund contains no notes; most of the songs were sung to popular melodies. According to the research of George Pullen Jackson, some melodies came from folk and love songs and others from chorales and hymns. The oldest melodies are from the 13th and 14th centuries. As with most Christian hymnbooks, the Amish normally use the Ausbund only in church. Their traditional melodies are called \"slow tunes\", but they put other melodies on the words during singing. Author Joseph Yoder compared the slow tempo of the music as it is sung today to Gregorian Chant, but this was not always the case. The Amish slow tunes of the 20th century are probably descended from tunes that the original Anabaptists knew. But over time, and with neither written notation nor musical instruments to keep the beat, the tunes have slowed down and ornamentation has been added in.\n\n\n== Samples ==\nAus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir\nLeonhard Schiemer: Dein heilig statt\nDein heilig statt hond sie zerst\u00f6rt, / dein Altar umbgegraben, / darzu auch deine Knecht erm\u00f6rdt, / wo sie's ergriffen haben. / Nur wir allein / dein heuflein klein, / sind wenig uberbliben, / mit schmach und schand / durch alle land / verjaget und vertriben.\nWir sind zerstrewt gleich wie die schaf, / die keinen Hirten haben, / verlassen unser hau\u00df und hooff / und sind gleich dem Nachtraben, / der sich auch offt / hewlt in steinklufft. / In Felsen und in klufften / ist unser gmach, / man stellt uns nach, / wie V\u00f6glein in der lufften.\nWir schleichen in den W\u00e4lden umb, / man sucht uns mit den Hunden, / man f\u00fchrt uns als die Lemlein stum / gefangen und gebunden. / Man zeigt uns an vor jedermann, / als weren wir Auffr\u00fcrer, / wir sind geacht / wie Schaf zur schlacht / als Ketzer und verf\u00fchrer.\nVil sind auch in den Banden eng / an ihrem leib verdorben, / ettliche durch die marter streng / umbkommen und gestorben / on alle schuld; / hie ist gedult / der Heiligen auff erden. / (..........?)\nMan hat sie an die b\u00e4um gehenkt, / erw\u00fcrget und zerhawen, / heimlich und \u00f6ffentlich ertrenckt / vil Weiber und jungfrawen. / Die haben frey / ohn alle schew / der warheit zeugnu\u00df geben, / dasz Jesus Christ / die wahrheit ist, / der weg und auch das leben.\nNoch tobt die Welt und ruhet nicht, / ist gar unsinnig worden, / vil l\u00fcgen sie auff uns erdicht, / mit brennen und mit morden / thut sie uns bang. / O Herr, wie lang / willtu dazzu doch schweigen? / Richt den hochmut, / der heiligen bluth / la\u00df wer dein Thron auffsteigen!\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlank, Benuel S.

            "The Magdeburg Centuries is an ecclesiastical history, divided into thirteen centuries, covering thirteen hundred years, ending in 1298; it was first published from 1559 to 1574. It was compiled by several Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg, known as the Centuriators of Magdeburg. The chief of the Centuriators was Matthias Flacius. Lutheran theologian Werner Elert argued that due to its revolutionary critical method of presenting history, it is the basis of all modern church history. It is said that Baronius undertook his Annales Ecclesiastici purely to oppose the Magdeburg Centuriators.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe Magdeburg Centuries demonstrates the continuity of the Christian faith throughout the ages. As the Centuries put it, Church history shows a \"perpetual agreement in the teaching of each article of faith in all ages\". Instead of presenting a Restorationist platform, the writers held that  \"this very form of the teaching which we now have in our churches because of the great kindness of God is that very ancient one, not a new one; genuine, not adulterous; true, not fabricated.\" The view of the work is generally pessimistic after the fifth century, in keeping with the writers' objective of presenting \"the origins and the increments of errors and their corrupting influences.\" \nPresenting a view of such corrupting errors by the Catholic Church, increasing and accumulating over a thousand years' time, served to legitimize the Reformation and make Lutherans rather than Catholics into the true heirs of the original Christianity founded by Jesus Christ and his disciples. Another characteristic of the work is the widespread use of primary sources rather than secondary or tertiary ones. In order to accomplish this, scholars traveled and borrowed manuscripts from all over Europe. With such diverse sources, one might expect a fractured or incoherent presentation of history. Instead, it provides a perspective that is completely independent from any of its sources, even though they are as wide-ranging as Gregory of Nazianzus and Alcuin.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nNot only are the volumes artificially divided by century rather than by historical eras, but each century is treated from a similar perspective, rather than from a fresh perspective for every era of history. Catholics have dissented from controversial historical arguments in the Centuries, made to discredit the papacy, including the identification of the pope as the Anti-Christ, and the legend of Pope Joan.\n\n\n== Full title ==\nThe full title of the work is Ecclesiastica Historia, integram Ecclesiae Christi ideam, quantum ad Locum, Propagationem, Persecutionem, Tranquillitatem, Doctrinam, H\u00e6reses, Ceremonias, Gubernationem, Schismata, Synodos, Personas, Miracula, Martyria, Religiones extra Ecclesiam, & statum Imperii politicum attinet, secundum singulas Centurias, perspicuo ordine complectens: singulari diligentia & fide ex vetustissimis & optimis historicis, patribus, & aliis scriptoribus congesta: Per aliquot studiosos & pios viros in urbe Magdeburgic\u00e2.\n\n\n== Origin and composition ==\nThe first three folio volumes of the work appeared in 1559 at Basel. It was the work of a group of Lutheran scholars who had gathered at Magdeburg, and who are now known to history as the Centuriators of Magdeburg because of the way in which they divided their work (century by century) and the place in which the first five volumes were written; most of the others were written at Wismar or elsewhere, but the subtitle in Urbe Magdeburgic\u00e2 was retained.\nThe originator of the idea and the moving spirit of the organization which produced the work was Matthias Vlacich (Latinized Flacius), also known as Francovich, and, from the country of his birth (Istria), Illyricus. Born in 1520, he went to university in 1539 in Switzerland and Germany, where, at Augsburg, Basle, T\u00fcbingen, and Wittenberg, he converted to Lutheranism. The Augsburg Interim of 1548 led to the Adiaphoristic controversy, in the course of which he wrote numerous harsh criticisms of the Reformer Philipp Melanchthon; the bitter feeling generated gave rise to the hostile parties of Philippists and Flacians. All attempts to restore peace failed, and the University of Jena, where Flacius was appointed professor of theology in 1557, became a centre of rigid Lutheranism in strong opposition to Melachthon. His wanderings after 1562, and the numerous domestic controversies between the Reformers, in which Flacius took part until his death (11 March 1575), did not prevent him from becoming the most learned Lutheran theologian of his day, while, in addition to numerous minor controversial works, his untiring energy led him to devise the vast historical work known as \"The Centuries\".\nAfter Martin Luther's death in 1546, anti-Catholic controversy tended to lose its dogmatic character and to become historical. Flacius critiqued the history of Catholicism, and in that spirit wrote his once famous and influential catalogue of anti-papal witnesses, Catalogus testium veritatis, qui ante nostram aetatem reclamarunt Papae (Basel, 1556; enlarged ed., Strasburg, 1562; ed. by Dietericus, Frankfort, 1672). Some four hundred anti-papal witnesses were cited, Pope Gregory I and Thomas Aquinas being included in the number of those who had stood up for truth against \"the Papal Antichrist\".\nAs early as 1553, Flacius was seeking patrons whose financial support should enable him to carry out his plan of a comprehensive church history which was \"to reveal the beginnings, the development and the ruthless designs of the Antichrist.\" The German princes, and the burghers particularly of Augsburg and Nuremberg, helped him generously, but no support was forthcoming from the followers of Melanchthon. He travelled through Germany in search of material while his co-worker, Marcus Wagner (from Weimar near Gotha), searched the libraries of Austria, Bavaria, Scotland, and Denmark for the same purpose.\nResearch has emphasized the importance of the assistance given by the crypto-Protestant, Caspar von Nydbruck, imperial counselor, and head of the Imperial Library of Vienna, whose influence was exerted throughout Europe on behalf of the work. The editorial board, Gubernatores et Inspectores institut histori\u00e6 Ecclesiastic\u00e6, was composed of Flacius, John Wigand (1523\u20131587), superintendent at Magdeburg, Matthew Judex (1528\u20131576), preacher at Magdeburg, Basil Faber (1525\u20131576), humanist, who collaborated in the first four Centuries, Martin Copusgas, a physician who acted as treasurer, and Eblinek Alman, a burgher of Magdeburg, each of whom had his own assistants. Seven junior assistants were appointed to compile extracts from early Christian writers and historians in accordance with a fixed plan; two more mature scholars acted as \"architects\", grouped the material, and submitted it to the editors. When approved, the materials were worked up into chapters and again submitted before the final form was fair-copied.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nAn analysis of the Quarta Centuria, (Fourth Century) which appeared in 1560, will give an idea of the contents:\n\nTitle page\ndedication to Queen Elizabeth (co. 3\u201312)\nbrief statement of the chief events of the century (col.13)\nspread of the Church: where and how (13\u201335)\npersecution and peace of the Church under Diocletian and Maximian (35\u2013159)\nthe Church's teaching and its history (160\u2013312)\nheresies (312\u2013406)\nrites and ceremonies (406 -483)\nChurch discipline and government (483\u2013582)\nschisms and controversies (583\u2013609)\ncouncils (609\u2013880)\nleading bishops and doctors (880\u20131337)\nleading heretics (1338\u20131403)\nthe martyrs (1403\u20131432)\nmiracles and miraculous occurrences (1433\u20131456)\npolitical relations of the Jews (1456\u20131462)\nother non-Christian religions (1462\u20131560)\npolitical changes (1560\u20131574)\nScriptural index (8 cols.)\ngeneral index (92 pages of four columns)\nThis method was applied only to the first thirteen centuries, which were published separately in folio volumes at Basel; I\u2013III in 1559 (reprinted 1560, 1562, 1564); IV in 1560 (reprinted 1562); V and VI in 1562; VII and VIII in 1564; IX in 1565; X and XI in 1567; XII in 1569; and XIII in 1574. The three remaining centuries were completed in manuscript by Wigand (who was largely responsible for all the work done between 1564\u201374), but never published, and the various attempts made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to continue the work came to naught. In 1624, a complete edition of the Centuries in six folio volumes was issued at Basel by Louis Lucius, who omitted the authors' names and dedications, and introduced various modifications of the text in a Calvinistic sense. A third edition appeared at Nuremberg 1757\u20131765, but did not get beyond the fifth century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLatin edition of 1757, HathiTrust Digital Library\nBaudouin, Flacius, and the Plan for the Magdeburg Centuries\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

            "Monas Hieroglyphica (or The Hieroglyphic Monad) is a book by John Dee, the Elizabethan magus and court astrologer of Elizabeth I of England, published in Antwerp in 1564. It is an exposition of the meaning of an esoteric symbol that he invented.\nDee's Monas Hieroglyphica presents a complex emblem constructed from various astrological symbols, with elements of Latin wordplay, capitalization, spacing, and diacritics, rendering its interpretation challenging. The symbol is intended to embody a profound concept, representing the unity of all creation influenced by celestial forces. Dee believed that this symbol contained the essence of alchemical transformation and spiritual evolution, and by meditating upon it, he aimed to access hidden knowledge transcending linguistic barriers. In merging astrology, alchemy, mysticism, and metaphysics, the Hieroglyphic Monad serves as a visual manifestation of Dee's interconnected worldview.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\nUnderstanding the text is difficult because of Dee's Latin wordplay, unexplained capitalization, odd spacing and diacritics.\n\n\n== Meaning of the symbol ==\n\nJohn Dee intended the Monad to incorporate a wide range of mystical and esoteric concepts. This complex symbol was meant to symbolize the unity of all creation, influenced by astrological and planetary forces. Dee believed it held the essence of alchemical transformation and spiritual growth. By meditating on the Monad, he thought to gain insights into hidden knowledge about the universe, transcending language barriers and tapping into profound truths. Overall, Dee's intention was to encapsulate his interconnected worldview, combining elements of astrology, alchemy, mysticism, and metaphysics.\n\n\n== Reception and influence ==\nThe book received little notice in English sources, though it is praised in the 1591 edition of George Ripley's The Compound of Alchymy as well as in Elias Ashmole\u2019s Theatrum  Chemicum  Britannicum (1652). A number of references appear in other languages, for example, Jean-Jacques  Manget\u2019s Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa (1702) and Lazarus Zetzner\u2019s Theatrum Chemicum (1602; 1659\u20131661); the latter reproduces the Monas Hieroglyphica in its entirety.\nGerard Dorn's Judgement of the Spagiric Art of Johann Trithemius contains terms and phrases based on the Monas, and his commentary on the Tractatus  Aureus references the words (\"Vulgaris, Hic, Oculus caligabit, diffidetque plurimum\") accompanying a figure in the Monas, saying \"with the eyes of the mind, for the vulgar eye, as John Dee of London says, will here find fault and be most distrustful.\" Peter Forshaw suggests that it is likely that Dorn's use of the same line and circle figure in his Monarchia Physica or Monarchia Triadis, in Unitate (1577) is a reference to the figure in Dee. It is also reproduced in the English logician, mathematician, and medic Thomas Oliver\u2019s  De  Sophismatum  praestigijs cauendis admonitio (1604). His further comments in the work suggest that he was also familiar with Dee\u2019s \"Mathematicall Praeface\" to Billingsley\u2019s translation of Euclid\u2019s Elements of Geometrie (1570).\nGiulio Cesare Capaccio refers to the Monas in his Delle imprese (On devices) (1592), paraphrasing content from the preface and mentioning the 'recondite Kabbalistic philosophy\u2019 of 'Giovanni Dee da Londino.' Cesare della Riviera includes Dee's glyph, without attribution, in his Il Mondo Magico de gli Heroi (1605). The glyph is also reproduced in the Amphitheatrum  sapientiae  aeternae (1595; 1609) of Heinrich Khunrath, where it is used in a more alchemical context. \nThe glyph was adopted by the Rosicrucians and appears on a page of the Rosicrucian manifesto Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (1616), beside the text of the invitation to the Royal Wedding given to Christian Rosenkreuz, who narrates the work. Frances Yates notes that Dee's influence later \"spread to Puritanism in the New World through John Winthrop the Younger, an alchemist and a follower of Dee; Winthrop used the 'monas' as his personal mark.\"\n\n\n== Publications ==\nDee, John (1564).

            "The Scottish Psalter of 1564 was the first psalter or psalm book to be published in Scotland. It was published by the Church of Scotland under the influence of John Knox as part of the Book of Common Order which was a more general directory for public worship. The precise details concerning the publication of the Scottish Psalter are not known as the early records of the Church of Scotland are lost.  However, it appears that its publication was determined at the Church's General Assembly in December 1562.\n\n\n== Background and composition ==\nIn 1556 the first Anglo-Genevan Psalter (English versifications of Calvin's Genevan Psalter) was published for the use of John Knox's congregation and contained 51 psalms, most of which originated in England from the poets Thomas Sternhold and John Hopkins. It formed the basis of the first Scottish Psalter of 1564, which reproduced the Anglo-Genevan Psalter with most of its tunes, completing it on the same principles to contain all 150 psalms. Neither of these included hymns. The text of this Psalter expresses the spirit of the original without undue pains to render the text literally. While only the melodies of the tunes were printed, part singing was certainly known, as there is a record of a four-part rendition of Psalm 124 being sung to welcome John Durie back to Edinburgh from exile in 1582. There were 30 metres in all: ninety-eight psalms were set to common metre, 10 to long metre, 6 to short metre and 4 to long metre (6 lines), and there were 26 metres for the other 32 psalms. Some editions of this Psalter printed in 1575 or later included up to 10 other pieces, but these were probably only intended for devotional purposes. Duguid has shown that the Scottish General Assembly closely guarded psalm publishing and had previously disciplined printers for editing the psalms (as had also been done in Calvin's Geneva).\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe 1564 edition went through many changes that culminated with the 1635 version. Edited by Edward Millar, the 1635 Scottish Psalter included the very best of the psalm settings for the Sternhold and Hopkins psalms. This included four-part homophonic settings of many of the psalms (those texts that did not have a proper melody were assigned a melody from another psalm), several more complicated or polyphonic psalm settings (also known as Psalms in Reports), and settings of many of the so-called Common Tunes that had come to be used in the seventeenth century.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHymnbooks of the Church of Scotland\n\n\n== References =="

            "Adventures of Captain Marvel is a 1941 American 12-chapter black-and-white movie serial from Republic Pictures, produced by Hiram S. Brown, Jr., directed by John English and William Witney, that stars Tom Tyler in the title role of Captain Marvel and Frank Coghlan, Jr. as his alter ego, Billy Batson. The serial was adapted from the popular Captain Marvel comic book character, then appearing in the Fawcett Comics publications Whiz Comics and Captain Marvel Adventures. The character is now owned by DC Comics and is known as Shazam.\nAdventures of Captain Marvel was the 21st of 66 film serials produced by Republic and their first comic book character adaptation (not counting comic strips). The serial featured the Fawcett Comics superhero, placed within an original screen story. It is considered the first comic book superhero movie. Captain Marvel fights a masked criminal mastermind called the Scorpion, who is determined to gain control of an ancient weapon. It is made in the form of a large metallic scorpion with adjustable legs, tail, and removable lenses that must be properly aligned in order to activate its powerful ray.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring an archaeological expedition to find the secret of the Scorpion Kingdom in Siam's volcanic Valley of the Tombs, a device of great power, the Golden Scorpion, is discovered hidden inside a sealed crypt. While examining it, the device's quartz lenses are aligned and a powerful energy beam is released, causing an explosion that reseals the crypt. This allows young radio broadcaster and expedition member Billy Batson, who obeyed the warning on the crypt's seal not to enter, to be chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam. The wizard grants Billy the powers of Captain Marvel whenever he repeats the wizard's name. Captain Marvel's powers can be used only to protect those in danger from the curse of the Golden Scorpion. After the crypt's entrance is quickly cleared, Captain Marvel utters \"Shazam!\", and returns to his previous alter ego, Billy Batson.\nThe Golden Scorpion's lenses are divided among the scientists of the Malcolm Archaeological Expedition so that its power can only be used by an agreement of the entire group. When the scientists return to the U.S., an all-black-garbed-and-hooded criminal mastermind, called the Scorpion, steals the ancient device and sets about stealing the distributed power lenses. Several expedition members are killed in the Scorpion's quest, despite Captain Marvel's frequent efforts thwarting his plan. Deducing that the Scorpion always seems to know what happens during the scientists' meetings, Billy later confides to his friends, Betty Wallace and Whitey Murphy, his suspicion that the Scorpion may be one of the Malcolm archaeological team.\nDiscovering that one of the Golden Scorpion's power lenses was purposely left behind, cleverly hidden in the very crypt where it was first discovered, Billy Batson and the surviving scientists agree it must be retrieved. They return by cargo ship to Siam where, near landfall, they barely survive a typhoon before finally being rescued by Captain Marvel. They eventually retrieve the hidden lens, but it is stolen by the Scorpion. By accident, from a distance, the Scorpion observes Captain Marvel transforming back into Billy Batson. Capturing Billy and gagging him, the Scorpion interrogates him about his secret. Billy's tape gag is removed when he agrees to talk. \"Shazam\"! is his only response, and he transforms in a flash of light and smoke into Captain Marvel. The Scorpion's identity is revealed to be one of the last surviving scientists. He is killed by a Siamese native who aligns the power lenses and turns the device's ray on him, vaporizing him.\nCaptain Marvel tosses the Golden Scorpion and its lenses into a volcano's molten lava to prevent them from ever being used for evil. Upon its destruction, Captain Marvel is instantly transformed back into Billy Batson forever, the danger from the device's curse having now been eliminated.\n\n\n=== Chapters ===\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nAdventures of Captain Marvel was budgeted at $135,553, although the final negative cost was $145,588 (a $10,035, or 7.4%, overspend). It was filmed between December 23, 1940, and January 30, 1941, under the working title Captain Marvel. The serial's production number was 1098.\nThe serial was the outgrowth of Republic's lengthy failed attempt at licensing Action Comics' (DC Comics today) Superman character. Paramount Pictures successfully tied up all the character's theatrical exhibition rights for its series of color Superman cartoons, produced for them by Fleischer Studios, which was awarded the license by the publisher. The license that Action Comics provided gave Paramount exclusive use and prevented other film companies from using the Superman character, even in a non-animated production. Undaunted, Republic's completed script was reworked with various changes; it now had an original masked hero, the Copperhead, standing in for Superman, subsequently becoming the Mysterious Doctor Satan serial. The studio then approached Fawcett Comics about filming their most popular superhero, and they agreed. Director William Witney, however, was skeptical about trying to adapt Captain Marvel after the problems encountered with Superman. In spite of this, Adventures of Captain Marvel became the first superhero film adaptation of a comic book character.\nNational attempted legal action to prevent Republic from developing their arch rival's most successful character, citing Republic's failure at adapting a Superman serial. Their attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Captain Marvel went into production. Writing in his autobiography of the period, William Witney revealed that in his court deposition he had claimed that both Superman and Captain Marvel were derivatives of Popeye. About a decade later, following an ongoing legal battle with National and a declining comics market, Fawcett ceased publication of all its comic book titles. In the 1970s the dormant Captain Marvel family of characters was licensed and revived by DC Comics, which they ultimately wound up purchasing, adding a final chapter to the Fawcett/DC saga.\nThe opening military scenes in the serial were reused footage lifted from Republic's 1938 film Storm Over Bengal.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nRepublic cast Frank Coghlan as Billy Batson due to his physical resemblance to the character. There was, however, some criticism that Tom Tyler did not sufficiently resemble the \"beefy, baby-faced\" Captain Marvel. At the time, Tyler was a weightlifting champion and the serial costume matched Captain Marvel's original comic book appearance, right down to his being slender. By the time of the serial's release, the appearance of Captain Marvel had changed due to Fawcett comics artist C. C. Beck changing the way he drew the character.\nTyler was described as clumsy, knocking over props with his \"lanky arms\". Punches in fight scenes would sometimes connect.\nDue to his convincing performance in King of the Royal Mounted, actor Robert Strange (as John Malcolm) was the obvious choice to be the identity of the Scorpion, but by the end of the serial he was just a diversion and not actually the villain.\n\n\n=== Special effects ===\n\nRepublic's flying effects, under the direction of Howard and Theodore Lydecker, were performed using a dummy that was slightly larger than life (at 7 feet tall) and made of paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 so that it weighed only 15 lbs. The uniform was made of thin silk and cotton jersey. Four pulleys were connected to each shoulder and leg calf, which were then strung on two wires so the dummy moved along them by its own weight. The wires were attached to two opposite objects running across the camera's field of view, and the dummy then slid from one to the other, giving the illusion of flight. This system was originally intended for use in their Superman serial; a prototype dummy was even built but later discarded. The flying pose used for the dummy (arms outstretched and back arched) was based upon a Captain Marvel drawing by comics artist Mac Raboy. If the dummy needed to be seen flying upwards, the cape was convincingly weighted and the dummy was then slid backwards. The film sequence was then optically printed in reverse, completing the flying illusion.\nStuntman David Sharpe was the human part of the effect. Dressed as Captain Marvel, he would leap from a high point with his body straight, as if able to fly, then roll to land at the last second. The combination of flying effects and stunts produced the overall illusion of a flying person. Sharpe also performed other stunts as Captain Marvel, such as back flipping and knocking down attacking Siamese tribesmen in the first chapter. Some shots of Captain Marvel flying were filmed with Tom Tyler posed against rear-projected clouds. Some of these scenes, however, show the suspension wires used to hold him up.\nAccording to author Raymond William Stedman, the flight scenes were the most successful illusion of such aerobatics put upon the screen, in serial or feature.\nThe technique had been developed in their earlier serial Darkest Africa (1936) and was later used again in their \"rocket man\" serials (King of the Rocket Men, Radar Men from the Moon, Zombies of the Stratosphere, and Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe) released from 1949 through 1953.\nBy contrast, the lower-budget Columbia Pictures Superman serials, which eventually appeared in the late 1940s awkwardly used cartoon animation sequences to represent Superman's flying scenes; The effect  vastly inferior to those for Republic's live-action sequences in Captain Marvel. Columbia produced the cheapest serials of the era, and producer Sam Katzman was notorious for cutting costs to the bone. Ironically, the decision to use cartoon animation for Superman's flying is puzzling, since these  scenes took longer to make and cost more than a mechanical effect as Republic used.\n\n\n=== Costume ===\nOne of Captain Marvel's tunics later appeared as the costume of a member of the Kryptonian science counsel in the first episode of The Adventures of Superman television series, filmed in 1951. The lightning bolt on the tunic is partially concealed by means of an oversize collar around the actor's neck.\nAfter the usage in the Superman TV series, two Captain Marvel tunics were worn by actors in early episodes of the pioneering U. S. science fiction TV series Space Patrol. Very early into the series, those Marvel tunics were replaced by custom made shirts.\nAt the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington, one of the remaining Captain Marvel tunics is on public display.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical releases ===\nAdventures of Captain Marvel's official release date was March 28, 1941, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. The serial was re-released on April 15, 1953, under the title Return of Captain Marvel, between the first runs of Jungle Drums of Africa and Canadian Mounties vs. Atomic Invaders.\nDue to the superhero nostalgia craze in the U. S. during the spring of 1966, resulting from the hit Batman television series, the serial was quickly re-released again, this time as a complete, nearly four-hour-long feature film. All 12 chapters were just strung together, each opening with the prior chapter's ending scenes and a plot synopsis, forcing audiences to sit through a summation of what they had just watched in the previous chapter.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nRepublic Pictures released the serial as a two-tape VHS set in 1995 and then again in 2003 on DVD as a two-disc set. Kino International released the serial on Blu-ray on September 19, 2017; it contains a commentary track provided by film historians Jerry Beck, Chris Eberle, Shane Kelly, Boyd Magers, Leonard Maltin, Adam Murdough, Constantine Nasr, Donnie Waddell, Tom Weaver, and J.D. Witney.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAuthors Jim Harmon and Donald F. Glut claim that Adventures of Captain Marvel is one of the finest movie serials ever made, with the exception of the three Flash Gordon serials. Author William C. Cline describes this as one of the most outstanding of all serials and Republic's \"masterpiece\". He writes that Tyler's \"striking\" performance remained in thousands of minds as the most memorable serial hero of all time.\nQuentin Tarantino called Tyler's Marvel \"the most homicidal berserker superhero\" of cinema.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nThe characters of Betty Wallace, Whitey Murphy, and John Malcolm all appeared in the Fawcett comics in the 1940s, beginning with \"Capt. Marvel and the Temple of Itzalotahui\" (Whiz Comics #22, Oct. 3, 1941) featuring Murphy and Malcolm; Murphy made several appearances in the 1970s DC Comics incarnation of Captain Marvel, as featured in the comic series Shazam! and World's Finest Comics.\nFawcett also published a sequel to the 1941 serial. Titled The Return of the Scorpion, it was one of the four releases in its Dime Action Books series, which imitated the format of the popular Big Little Books. The book is notable for reusing several characters from the serial and for being Otto Binder's first writing assignment at Fawcett; he went on to be a prolific comics writer for the company.\nIn 1994 comic book writer/artist Jerry Ordway wrote and painted a graphic novel, The Power of Shazam!, and an ongoing comic book series spin-off, which ran from 1995 to 1999. Ordway used the Republic serial as his initial inspiration in his handling of the Captain Marvel characters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nThe Adventures of Captain Marvel (full 12 chapter serial) on YouTube\nAdventures of Captain Marvel at IMDb\nAdventures of Captain Marvel is available for free viewing and download at the Internet Archive\nSerial Pictorial Number One: The Adventures of Captain Marvel",
            "Atom Man vs. Superman is a 1950 American film serial and the second Superman movie serial featuring Kirk Alyn, credited (as with the previous serial) only by his character name, Superman.\nWhen Lex Luthor blackmails the city of Metropolis by threatening to destroy the entire community, Perry White, editor of the Daily Planet assigns Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Clark Kent to cover the story. The first chapter was released in July 1950.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLex Luthor, the Atom Man, invents a number of deadly devices to plague the city, including a disintegrating machine which can reduce people to their basic atoms and reassemble them in another place. Superman manages to thwart each scheme. Since Kryptonite can rob Superman of his powers, Luthor decides to create a synthetic Kryptonite and putters about obtaining the necessary ingredients: plutonium, radium and the undefined 'etc.' Luthor places the Kryptonite at the launching of a ship, with Superman in attendance. He is exposed to the Kryptonite and passes out. Superman is taken off in an ambulance driven by Luthor's henchmen, and he is now under the control of Luthor. Superman is placed in a device, a lever is pulled, and the Man of Steel vanishes into \"The Empty Doom\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nKirk Alyn as Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman\nNoel Neill as Lois Lane\nLyle Talbot as Lex Luthor / Atom Man\nTommy Bond as Jimmy Olsen\nPierre Watkin as Perry White\nJack Ingram as Foster\nDon C. Harvey as Albor\nRusty Wescoatt as Carl\nTerry Frost as Baer\nWally West as Dorr\nPaul Stader as \"Killer\" Lawson\nGeorge Robotham as Earl\nNoel Neill would return to the role of Lois Lane in 1953, replacing Phyllis Coates in the second through sixth (and final) seasons of The Adventures of Superman, and would be the model for Metropolis, Illinois' 2010 Lois Lane statue.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nLyle Talbot, who had previously starred as Commissioner Jim Gordon in the 1949 Columbia Serial Batman and Robin, here portrays Lex Luthor (and also Luthor's alter-ego \"Atom Man\"). In his \"Atom Man\" disguise, Talbot as Luthor, utilizes a vaguely German accent and wears an ominous mask fashioned from a \"Metallogen Man\" robot costume left over from 1945's The Monster and the Ape. Despite their onscreen personas, Talbot (Lex Luthor), who wore a rubber scalp to create the impression of baldness, and Alyn (Superman) spent much of their time, when not shooting, exchanging recipes, both actors shared an interest in cookery.\n\n\n=== Special effects ===\nThe final set piece shows Metropolis under attack by \"poorly animated\" flying saucers and a torpedo.\nThe flying effects were somewhat improved in this film than in the original, by the simple expedient of turning the camera on its side. Kirk Alyn stood with arms raised in front of a cyclorama, while a wind machine and smoke pot were placed above him (out of frame). This gave an inexpensive illusion of flight. Longer shots continued to use cartoon animation of the Man of Steel.\n\n\n== Critical appraisal ==\nIn their book The Great Movie Serials, Jim Harman and Donald F. Glut describe the serial as \"far more gimmicky and gadget prone\" than the first Superman serial. In addition to this, they also found it to be flawed with its cheapness characteristic in Katzman productions.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nIn 2006, the Atom Man vs. Superman serial was still available for purchase on VHS videotape, where it was first released back in 1989 as a double tape box set. The serial was also offered available in two separate VHS tapes as Volume 1 (Chapters 1 - 7) and Volume 2 (Chapters 8 - 15). It was officially released on DVD by Warner Home Video, along with its predecessor, 1948's Superman, on November 28, 2006 as Superman - The Theatrical Serials Collection.\nWith the previous 2006 DVD release out of print for a few years, on October 9, 2018 the serials were re-released as manufactured-on-demand (MOD) DVD from Warner Archive Collection.\n\n\n== Chapter titles ==\nSuperman Flies Again\nAtom Man Appears\nAblaze In The Sky\nSuperman Meets Atom Man\nAtom Man Tricks Superman\nAtom Man's Challenge\nAt The Mercy Of Atom Man\nInto The Empty Doom\nSuperman Crashes Through\nAtom Man's Heat Ray\nLuthor's Strategy\nAtom Man Strikes\nAtom Man's Flying Saucers\nRocket Of Vengeance\nSuperman Saves The Universe\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of film serials by year\nList of film serials by studio\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAtom Man vs. Superman at IMDb\nAtom Man vs. Superman at Rotten Tomatoes\nAtom Man vs. Superman at AllMovie\nSuperman.UGO.com",
            "Batman (also known as Batman: The Movie) is a 1966 American superhero film directed by Leslie H. Martinson. Based on the television series, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the DC Comics character of the same name, the film stars Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. The film hit theaters two months after the last episode of the first season of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of Julie Newmar as Catwoman, who, in the movie, was replaced by Lee Meriwether.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWhen Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp, owner of the Big Ben Distillery, is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the Batcopter. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellent, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City: the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, and the Catwoman.\nThe four criminals equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust until they are rehydrated (an invention of Schmidlapp's, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), escape in a war-surplus, pre-atomic submarine made to resemble a penguin, and recruit three pirate-themed henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). Batman and Robin learn that the yacht was really a holographic projection and return via Batboat to a buoy concealing a projector, where they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist \"Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff\" (acronymed as Kitka) of the Moscow Bugle, helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin's explosive animals (of course unaware that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego).\nAfter Bruce Wayne fights his way out of captivity, he again disguises himself as Batman, and the Dynamic Duo returns to the United Underworld's HQ, only to find a smoking bomb. Batman is met with frustration rushing all over the docks unable to locate a safe place to dispose of the bomb but finally does so in the nick of time. The Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: the Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile, leaving them highly unstable. Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council, consisting of ambassadors from Japan, the U.S, the U.S.S.R., Israel, France, Spain, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and Nigeria. Giving chase in the Batboat to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable The Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues.\nAlthough Batman and Robin come out on top, Batman is heartbroken to discover that his \"true love\" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when she loses her mask. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the powdered Council members' vials and sneezes on them, scattering the dust. Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate Super Molecular Dust Separator to filter the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.\nWith the world watching, the Security Council is re-hydrated. All members are restored alive and well, but continue to squabble amongst themselves, totally oblivious of their surroundings; however, each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this \"strange mixing of minds\" does more good than harm. The duo quietly leaves United World Headquarters by climbing out of the window and descending on their bat-ropes.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nWilliam Dozier wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed Batman television series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, 20th Century-Fox, refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).\nThe studio acquiesced after a 1965 screening of Columbia Pictures' 1943 The Batman serial in New York City renewed interest in the character and after the television series became phenomenally successful. The project was announced in a March 26, 1966, issue of Variety magazine.\nThe film features many characters from the show. It was written by series writer Lorenzo Semple Jr. and directed by Leslie H. Martinson, who had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes: \"The Penguin Goes Straight\" and \"Not Yet, He Ain't\". Semple Jr. completed the screenplay in 10 days. Principal photography began on April 28, 1966, and concluded within 28 days, with a further three days to complete second-unit photography.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nThe film includes most members of the original TV cast: the actors for Batman, Robin, Alfred, Gordon, O'Hara, Aunt Harriet, the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler all reprised their roles. Though Julie Newmar had at this point played Catwoman in two episodes of season one in the TV series, she had other commitments at that time and was replaced by Lee Meriwether in the film. According to the Biography special Catwoman: Her Many Lives aired on July 20, 2004, Newmar was unable to reprise her role because of a back injury. Catwoman was nonetheless played by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of season two of the series; Eartha Kitt would then play Catwoman in three episodes of season three.\nJack LaLanne has a cameo as a man on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.\n\n\n=== Tone and themes ===\nEven though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. They felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader \"captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly\". The film was made at a time when \"the Batman of the Golden Age comics was already essentially neutered\".\nCertain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck. The penchant for giving devices a \"Bat-\" prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of Batman's campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.\nFurthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into Cold War issues, paying heavy attention to Polaris Missiles, war surplus submarines and taking a poke at the Pentagon. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.\n\n\n=== Vehicles ===\n\nBesides the Batmobile, other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:\n\nBatcycle with side car\nBatboat, provided by Glastron\nBatcopter\nOf the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the Batman film, only the Batcycle properly crossed over into the TV series as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the Batcopter and Batboat from the movie appeared briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: \"Walk the Straight and Narrow\"), they primarily did so in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.\n\n\n== Music ==\nNelson Riddle's original score to Batman the Movie was released in 2010 by La-La Land Records and Fox Music. The album contains the entire score as heard in the film in chronological order as well as an unreleased cue. This limited edition includes a lavishly illustrated color booklet which features exclusive liner notes by Brian Baterwhite. This Limited Edition was of 2000 units.\nIt was newly re-issued in 2016. While the program and master of this release is identical to the 2010 release, this reissue features all-new exclusive liner notes by John Takis and art design by Jim Titus. This new Limited Edition is of 2500 units.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nBatman premiered at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas, on July 30, 1966 (between the first and second seasons of the TV series); it was moderately successful at the box office. The Batboat featured in the film was created by Austin-based company Glastron, whose payment was in having the film premiere in their hometown. In conjunction with the premiere, Jean Boone of Austin CBS affiliate station KTBC interviewed the film's cast, including Lee Meriwether, Cesar Romero, and Adam West.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nABC, the network which previously aired the Batman television series, first broadcast the film on the July 4, 1971, edition of The ABC Sunday Night Movie; the film was quickly rebroadcast on ABC September 4 of that year.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film debuted on home video via formats VHS and Betamax release in 1985 by Playhouse Video, then apparently re-released (after a Blockbuster Video executive asked why it wouldn't be repackaged on the heels of the successful Batman film of 1989) in 1989 by CBS/Fox Video, and in 1994 by Fox Video.\nThe film was released on DVD in 2001, and re-released July 1, 2008, on DVD and on Blu-ray by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAccording to Fox records, the film needed to earn $3.2 million in rentals to break even and made $3.9 million (equivalent to $36.6 million in 2023).\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nBatman holds an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on thirty-six reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Batman: The Movie elevates camp to an art form -- and has a blast doing it, every gloriously tongue-in-cheek inch of the way.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nBill Gibron of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars: \"Unlike other attempts at bringing these characters to life...the TV cast really captures the inherent insanity of the roles\". Variety stated in their review that \"the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively\".\n\n\n== Sequels ==\n\nWest and Ward reprised their roles in Batman animated movies for the show's 50th anniversary along with Julie Newmar returning.\nBatman: Return of the Caped Crusaders was released on Digital HD and digital media on October 11, 2016, and on DVD and Blu-ray November 1.\nA sequel to Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders called Batman vs. Two-Face was released on October 10, 2017. The film starred William Shatner voicing Two-Face as the main antagonist. Adam West completed his voiceover work, but died of Leukemia in June 2017, before it was released.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1966\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBatman at IMDb \nBatman at Rotten Tomatoes \nBatman at the TCM Movie Database \nBatman The Movie at BYTB: Batman Yesterday, Today and Beyond (archived 2006)\nBATMAN (1966, U.S.) at kiddiematinee.com (archived 2010)\nJean Boone \u2013 Interview with the cast of Batman: The Movie (1966) (archived 2008)",
            "The Batman is a 2022 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Batman. Directed by Matt Reeves from a screenplay he wrote with Peter Craig, it is a reboot of the Batman film franchise produced by DC Films. Robert Pattinson stars as Bruce Wayne / Batman alongside Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Paul Dano, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, Andy Serkis, and Colin Farrell. The film sees Batman, in his second year fighting crime in Gotham City, uncover corruption with ties to his own family while pursuing the Riddler (Dano), a mysterious serial killer targeting the city's elite.\nDevelopment began after Ben Affleck was cast as Batman in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) in 2013. Affleck signed on to direct, produce, co-write, and star in The Batman, but had reservations about the project and dropped out. Reeves took over in February 2017 and reworked the story, removing the DCEU connections to focus on a younger version of the character earlier in his vigilante career compared to Affleck's. He sought to explore Batman's detective side more than previous films, drawing inspiration from the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the New Hollywood era, and comics such as Year One (1987), The Long Halloween (1996\u201397), and Ego (2000). Pattinson was cast in May 2019, with further casting later that year. Filming began in the United Kingdom in January 2020, but was halted in March by the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed later in the year and concluded in Chicago in March 2021.\nThe Batman was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on March 4, 2022, three days after premiering at the Lincoln Center in Manhattan, and was delayed twice from its original June 2021 release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was a commercial success, grossing $771 million against a $185\u2013200 million budget, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2022. It received positive reviews from critics, was nominated for three awards at the 95th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The film is intended to launch a Batman shared universe and is set to be followed by two sequels, with The Batman \u2013 Part II set to be released on October 2, 2026. A spin-off television series, The Penguin, starring Farrell, debuted on HBO in September 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by a masked serial killer, the Riddler. Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates the murder alongside Lieutenant Jim Gordon, much to the disdain of the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). The Riddler has left a message for Batman at the crime scene. The following night, the Riddler kills Commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell's affair with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge\u2014a nightclub operated by Oswald \"The Penguin\" Cobb, who is crime boss Carmine Falcone's lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Annika's roommate Selina Kyle works at the club as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage, Mitchell, and the district attorney Gil Colson are on Falcone's payroll.\nThe Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third\u2014the name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending mob boss Salvatore Maroni's operation\u2014and is killed. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation was transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika's corpse in the trunk of a car. Batman captures the Penguin after a car chase, but he and Gordon learn that the Penguin is not the informant.\nBatman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage initially funded by Bruce's deceased parents Thomas and Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family for failing the orphanage. Bruce's butler and caretaker Alfred Pennyworth is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill Maroni's journalist who was writing a story about Martha's family history of mental illness. Bruce confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence; upon learning that Falcone had murdered the journalist instead, Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to silence them.\nSelina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her father. After learning that Falcone killed Annika for discovering that he was the informant, Selina tries to kill him, but Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her. Gordon arrests Falcone, but the Riddler kills Falcone with a sniper rifle moments later. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has planted car bombs and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Re\u00e1l. The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's followers attempt to kill Re\u00e1l, but Batman and Selina manage to stop them. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate, while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRobert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne / Batman:A reclusive billionaire who obsessively protects Gotham City as a masked vigilante to cope with his traumatic past. Batman is around 30 years old and is not yet an experienced crime fighter, because director Matt Reeves wanted to explore the character before he becomes \"fully formed\". Reeves and Pattinson described Batman as an insomniac who cannot delineate between the Batman persona and his \"recluse rockstar\" public identity as Bruce, with Reeves comparing his obsession with being Batman to a drug addiction. Pattinson said the film questions the nature of heroism, as Batman is more flawed than traditional superheroes and unable to control himself, seeking to work out his rage and \"inflict his kind of justice\". Reeves considered The Batman a story about Batman learning that he must not exact vengeance, but inspire hope. Oscar Novak portrays a young Bruce, while Rick English was Pattinson's stunt double.\nZo\u00eb Kravitz as Selina Kyle / Catwoman:A nightclub waitress, drug dealer, and cat burglar who meets Batman while searching for her missing roommate; her moral ambiguity challenges Batman's black-and-white view of good and evil. Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in the 2017 animated film The Lego Batman Movie, said the character is becoming a femme fatale and \"figuring out who she is, beyond just someone trying to survive\". She described her as a mysterious character with unclear motivations, who represents femininity in contrast to Batman's masculinity. She said the pair are \"partner[s] in crime\", drawn together by their desire to fight for vulnerable people. Reeves saw Selina as Batman's awakening to his own sheltered upbringing and preconceived assumptions. Kravitz focused more on Selina than her Catwoman persona because she did not want to distract from the character's emotional journey, and interpreted Selina as bisexual, which the character is depicted as in the comics.\nPaul Dano as Edward Nashton / Riddler:A forensic accountant who is inspired by Batman to become a serial killer who targets elite Gotham citizens and live streams his crimes. An orphan raised in abject poverty, he resents Gotham's rich and powerful for ignoring the less fortunate, and seeks to \"unmask the truth\" about Gotham, taunting Batman and law enforcement with riddles. Reeves said Batman inspiring the Riddler reflects the idea from the comics that he creates his own enemies and that the Riddler's attack on Gotham gives the character a \"political agenda\" as a terrorist-like figure. He found Batman and the Riddler being \"kind of two sides of the same coin\" unsettling, as they have similar goals. He likened the Riddler to the Zodiac Killer, who he felt was the \"real-life\" Riddler for his practice of communicating with ciphers and riddles, while Dano said his performance balanced the real-life basis with the Batman franchise's theatricality. Joseph Walker portrays a young Nashton. As a result of citogenesis, the character is also depicted as using the alias \"Patrick Parker\".\nJeffrey Wright as James \"Jim\" Gordon:An ally of Batman in the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). He is the only GCPD officer whom Batman trusts, and they work together to solve the Riddler case. Wright described Gordon as \"relative to Gotham City, to the Gotham City Police Department, to Batman, to justice and to corruption\". Similar to Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005\u20132012), Gordon begins as a GCPD lieutenant in The Batman, allowing his progression to commissioner to be depicted in subsequent films. Wright felt starting Gordon as the lieutenant enabled him to play a larger role compared to previous film iterations. Reeves felt that Batman and Gordon's partnership is emphasized more in The Batman than it was in previous Batman films, and compared them to Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) from All the President's Men (1974).\nJohn Turturro as Carmine Falcone:A Gotham crime boss and Selina's father. The Riddler's primary target, Falcone has much of Gotham under his control; Turturro described him as a \"dangerous guy\", while Reeves said he was \"seemingly...a genteel mobster but [he] turns out to have a very, very dark history behind him\" and compared him to Noah Cross (John Huston) from Chinatown (1974). The Batman suggests that Falcone played a role in Batman's origin story by ordering the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Falcone wears vintage sunglasses throughout the film, as Turturro felt the character needed a \"mask\".\nPeter Sarsgaard as Gil Colson: Gotham's district attorney, whom Sarsgaard described as untruthful and \"distasteful\".\nAndy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth:Batman's butler and mentor, though they have a strained relationship and rarely speak. Pattinson described Alfred as Batman's only confidant, even though Alfred \"thinks he's gone insane!\" Alfred has a military background, which is reflected in him being \"used to rules and regulations, structure and precision\" as well as his attire and demeanor. To illustrate Alfred's physical appearance as a military veteran, Reeves came up with the idea of him having a cane, while Serkis suggested his facial scars. Serkis said Alfred was \"part of the secret service and then the security team looking after Wayne Enterprises\"; his background led to him becoming more of a \"mentor and a teacher\" than the father figure that Bruce needed. Reeves noted that Alfred was forced into becoming Bruce's parental figure despite being inexperienced and young, and feels guilty that his flawed parenting of Bruce might have led to his obsessive journey as Batman.\nColin Farrell as Oz / Penguin:Falcone's chief lieutenant who operates the Iceberg Lounge, the nightclub where Selina works. He is not yet the crime kingpin he is depicted as in the comics, and dislikes being referred to as the Penguin. Reeves explained that the Penguin is a \"mid-level mobster guy and he's got a bit of showmanship to him, but you can see that he wants more and that he's been underestimated\". Reeves compared the Penguin to Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) from The Godfather (1972), due to \"the insignificance that he lives within, in a family that is full of very strong, very bright, very capable, very violent men\". Penguin's surname, Cobb, was shortened from the original comic book name, Cobblepot, during the production of the spin-off series The Penguin (2024); during the film, he is only referred to as \"Oz\" or \"the Penguin\".\nSupporting cast members include: Jayme Lawson as Bella Re\u00e1l, a mayoral candidate for Gotham City who Reeves said represents hope; Gil Perez-Abraham as Martinez, a GCPD officer; Peter McDonald as William Kenzie, a corrupt GCPD officer; Alex Ferns as Pete Savage, the GCPD commissioner; Con O'Neill as Mackenzie Bock, the GCPD chief; and Rupert Penry-Jones as Don Mitchell Jr., Gotham's mayor. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo appearance as the Joker, who is credited as \"Unseen Arkham Prisoner\". Other cast members are: twins Charlie and Max Carver as Iceberg Lounge bouncers, who are credited as \"The Twins\"; Hana Hrzic as Annika, Selina's roommate; Jay Lycurgo as a young gang member; Akie Kotabe as a train passenger; Sandra Dickinson as Dory, Bruce's caretaker and housekeeper; and Luke Roberts and Stella Stocker as Bruce's parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, respectively.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\n==== Early work and initial plans from Ben Affleck ====\nBen Affleck was cast in August 2013 to portray the DC Comics character Bruce Wayne / Batman in multiple films set in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) media franchise. He made his debut in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), before appearing in Suicide Squad (2016) and Justice League (2017). In October 2014, Warner Bros. revealed plans for a standalone Batman film starring Affleck, and he was in negotiations to direct and co-write the screenplay with Geoff Johns by July 2015. Production was expected to begin after Affleck finished work on Live by Night (2016). Affleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016. Set after the events of Batman v Superman and Justice League, the script told an original story inspired by comic book elements, an approach that Affleck compared to director Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman story, with specific influence from Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth (1989) and \"Knightfall\" (1992\u20131994) as well as the video game Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009). Cinematographer Robert Richardson, who was attached early in development, confirmed that the script was primarily set in Arkham Asylum. It featured Slade Wilson / Deathstroke orchestrating a breakout at Arkham to tire Batman and make him vulnerable, before fighting him in the streets of Gotham during the climax. Batgirl was planned to appear and help Batman. Johns said the film would also explore the death of Robin, which was hinted at in Batman v Superman.\nWarner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara confirmed at CinemaCon in April 2016 that Affleck would direct the Batman film. Jeremy Irons said he would reprise his Batman v Superman role of Alfred Pennyworth in May, and Joe Manganiello was cast as Deathstroke in September. Manganiello explained that Deathstroke believed Batman was responsible for his son's death and was depicted as systematically dismantling Batman's life and killing those close to him like a \"horror movie villain\". He compared the story to David Fincher's The Game (1997). Snyder enjoyed the story and filmed a scene at the end of Justice League\u2014featuring Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) revealing Batman's secret identity to Deathstroke\u2014to help set up the film. Affleck revealed the title was The Batman in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a 2018 release. That month, a planned Justice League sequel was delayed to accommodate The Batman. Chris Terrio turned in a rewrite of the script in January 2017.\n\nAffleck began to have reservations about directing the film, and announced in January 2017 that he was stepping down as director but still planned to star and produce. He initially said he had stepped down to focus more on starring as Batman, but soon stated that he had been unable to get the script where he needed it and felt it was time for someone else to \"have a shot at it\". Affleck later added that he did not think he would have enjoyed directing the film and felt it should be directed by someone who would love working on it. At the time, Warner Bros. was re-evaluating its approach to superhero films following the release of Batman v Superman, which Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter said led to Affleck's film being \"sidelined\". The Justice League scene was altered in post-production to tease the Injustice League in a Justice League sequel instead of Deathstroke's role in The Batman, though the original was restored in the 2021 director's cut Zack Snyder's Justice League.\n\n\n==== Redevelopment under Matt Reeves ====\nMatt Reeves, Matt Ross, Ridley Scott, Gavin O'Connor, George Miller, Denis Villeneuve, and Fede \u00c1lvarez were all considered as replacements for Affleck as director. Reeves, a longtime Batman fan, quickly moved to the top of the shortlist and entered negotiations after meeting with Warner Bros. on February 10, 2017. Warner Bros. sent Reeves a copy of the script, but Reeves felt that Affleck's take, while \"totally valid\", was not the film he wanted to make. Reeves only wanted to join if he was guaranteed creative control, and Warner Bros. Pictures Group chair Toby Emmerich\u2014who wanted an \"auteur\" to make the next Batman film\u2014was impressed by his initial ideas. An issue with his salary soon arose, but it was quickly overcome, and Reeves was hired to direct The Batman on February 23. He was also set to produce the film with Dylan Clark. Reeves was not willing to share his full vision with the studio while he was working on War for the Planet of the Apes (2017), and Warner Bros. agreed to delay production until he was available.\nReeves began working on the script in March 2017. He initially planned to keep The Batman's connections to the DCEU and spoke with Affleck during the writing process, but soon reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his vigilante career, with plans to cast a younger actor to play Batman; Warner Bros. was planning to replace Affleck by July 2017. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, and it was considered unlikely that he would reprise his role in the film after that. At that time, Reeves said the script was nearing completion, and he hoped to finish it within a couple of weeks. He was aiming to begin production in early-to-mid-2019. Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month. Mattson Tomlin and Peter Craig also contributed to the script, though only Reeves and Craig received credit. Tomlin used some of the ideas he developed for The Batman in a comic book limited series, Batman: The Imposter (2021).\nIn January 2019, Warner Bros. scheduled a release date of June 25, 2021, for The Batman, and Affleck confirmed that he was no longer starring. Affleck explained that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from Jennifer Garner, the tumultuous production of Justice League, his lack of enjoyment in the role at that point, and his alcohol problems. Elaborating on his Justice League experience, Affleck said it had particularly soured his interest in the role since it involved his divorce, frequent traveling, and competing agendas, as well as the death of Snyder's daughter Autumn (which led to the director's exit from the project) and the subsequent extensive reshoots for the film. Affleck recalled that he had shown a version of The Batman's script to a friend who said, \"I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through [on Justice League] again\".\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nWhen Reeves decided to focus on Batman earlier in his vigilante career, he began writing a new script from scratch. Affleck's script had taken an action-driven approach similar to the James Bond franchise, but Reeves wanted a more personal narrative that would \"rock [Batman] to his core\". He wanted to explore how the Batman mythos could exist in the real world and chose to set the film during the second year of Batman's career rather than retell the character's origin story, as he wanted his take to be different from previous Batman films. He felt the film was \"more about someone who hadn't quite figured out why they were doing the thing they were doing\" and wanted it to focus on Batman's emotional arc, in which \"you see him go through tremendous trauma and then marshal the will to find a way through\". Reeves originally intended for his version of The Batman to be set in the DCEU, but eventually decided that this would distract from Batman's character arc and asked Warner Bros. for the creative freedom to move outside of the shared universe. Reeves wanted to be able to create a version of Batman with a \"personal aspect to it\", and felt he should not be obligated to connect it to other aspects of the DCEU. Warner Bros.' incorporation of the multiverse in its DC productions allowed Reeves to take the project in his own direction; as a consequence, the film takes place in a separate world known as \"Earth-2\".\n\nReeves knew early on that the film would draw from Batman: The Long Halloween (1996\u201397) and its sequel Dark Victory (1999\u20132000) by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, featuring Batman hunting a serial killer who \"would reveal this cooperation between the people who are legitimate pillars in the city and the criminal element in the city\". He decided to use the Riddler after noting parallels between the character and the Zodiac Killer, a costumed serial killer who operated in California in the 1960s, while reading Mindhunter (1995). Reeves imagined that Batman's investigation would have him encounter other figures from the comic book mythos, leading to the introduction of characters like Catwoman, the Penguin, and Carmine Falcone. However, Reeves sought to ensure that Batman remained the story's focus, and tried to include him in every scene.\nReeves re-read his favorite Batman comics, but did not base the film on a specific storyline. Particular influence came from \"Year One\" (1987) by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli, Ego (2000) by Darwyn Cooke, and \"Zero Year\" (2013\u201314) by Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo, as well as Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Neal Adams' runs on the character. Reeves drew from the depiction of a young, inexperienced Batman in \"Year One\", Catwoman's relationship to Falcone in The Long Halloween and Dark Victory, the exploration of Batman's psychology and his transition from exacting vengeance to inspiring hope in Ego, and the Riddler's plot to flood Gotham in \"Zero Year\". Other elements, such as Alfred's characterization, Thomas Wayne's mayoral campaign, and Martha Wayne being part of the Arkham family, came from Batman: Earth One (2012) by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank, while the theme of vengeance was inspired by Kevin Conroy's \"I am vengeance, I am the night\" speech from Batman: The Animated Series (1992\u20131999). The film also features references to other comic storylines, including \"No Man's Land\" (1999) and \"Hush\" (2002\u201303).\nIn portraying Bruce Wayne, Reeves wanted to depart from the traditional playboy and socialite; because he listened to the Nirvana song \"Something in the Way\" (1991) as he wrote the first act, he decided to base Bruce on reclusive Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He took inspiration from the film Last Days (2005), which features a fictionalized version of Cobain living in a \"decaying manor\". The Godfather (1972) character Michael Corleone also influenced Reeves' take on Bruce. Reeves sought to make Batman relatable while honoring what people love about him, and described his Batman as \"still trying to figure out how to do this, how to be effective, and he's not necessarily succeeding. He's broken and driven\". Although it does not depict Batman's origin\u2014in which he witnesses the murder of his parents\u2014The Batman still explores the emotional cost that it has on the character, with Reeves stating Batman is \"emotionally stunted at being 10 years old, because that's a trauma you don't get past\".\nUnlike previous Batman films, The Batman focuses on Batman's detective skills, with Reeves describing it as an \"almost-noir driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the character's heart and mind. He said the film blended the detective, action, horror, and psychological thriller genres, which he felt hewed closer to the comics than previous adaptations had. He also felt this approach made it the most frightening Batman film. Reeves looked to films and filmmakers from the New Hollywood era for inspiration, including The French Connection (1971), Klute (1971), Chinatown (1974), All the President's Men (1976), and Taxi Driver (1976), as well as the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Wong Kar-wai's short film The Hand (2004). Chinatown and All the President's Men influenced The Batman's depiction of a corrupt, decaying Gotham, while the relationship between Donald Sutherland and Jane Fonda's characters in Klute inspired the dynamic between Batman and Catwoman. Reeves said that he blended the inspirations to \"inform the story, motivation, imagery, and tone\" while also \"conjur[ing] something... evocative and unique\". To convey Batman's insecurity, Reeves added a scene, inspired by Manhunter (1986), featuring him visiting the Joker to profile the Riddler. Reeves also intended for the Joker's appearance to signify that Gotham's troubles would not end after the Riddler is captured.\nThe film contains a number of historical allusions, which Reeves felt would make it more believable. Two characters\u2014Mayor Don Mitchell Jr. and District Attorney Gil Colson\u2014share surnames with Watergate scandal figures John N. Mitchell and Charles Colson, and the Riddler's murder of Colson mirrors the death of Brian Wells. Additionally, Reeves based Falcone on Winter Hill Gang leader Whitey Bulger, citing the documentary Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger (2014) as an influence; a number of plot elements mirror events from Bulger's life, including Falcone serving as an informant and bribing city officials. Reeves and Craig had finished writing most of the script and requested Mattson Tomlin's assistance to complete the third act. They wrote the third act in six months, although Tomlin did not receive credit for his contributions. He explained that he spent that much time as he felt the \"bar is therefore very high\" due to Batman's popularity. He cited the scene in which Batman and Gordon enter the Riddler's apartment as one of his most difficult scenes as he wanted to visually convey Batman's fear that the Riddler is aware of his identity rather than using dialogue.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nRobert Pattinson, Nicholas Hoult, Armie Hammer, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, with Pattinson the frontrunner. Reeves wrote the script with Pattinson in mind after seeing his performance in Good Time (2017), but was unsure if he would be interested. Pattinson had eschewed major Hollywood franchise films since his work on the Twilight series (2008\u20132012), as he found those roles dull and wanted to avoid paparazzi attention. This meant he had not appeared in Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which made him desirable to Warner Bros. The other major contender, Hoult, appeared in the Marvel Comics\u2013based X-Men films, but those are separate from the MCU and Hoult was unrecognizable for much of them due to prosthetics and makeup.\nPattinson became interested in the role a year in advance and \"kept obsessively checking up on it\". A longtime Batman fan, he had ideas about how to bring a unique portrayal of the relationship between Batman's superhero activities and his identity as Bruce compared to previous film adaptations, and was interested in the character's lack of superpowers. Reeves spent hours reviewing Pattinson's and Hoult's previous work before meeting with them in April 2019. They were the only contenders for the role by May 20, and both flew to Burbank, California, for a screen test. Pattinson wore Val Kilmer's Batsuit from Batman Forever (1995) during his test since it was the only existing costume that fit him. The audition was challenging because the suit was small and difficult to move in, but Pattinson and Reeves found it a \"transformative\" experience. Pattinson was cast on May 31, with a salary of $3 million.\nPattinson's casting was met with backlash from some Batman fans, with a Change.org petition calling to reverse the decision. Pattinson said he found the response less vitriolic than he had expected, and felt that being an underdog meant he did not have expectations to meet in his performance. Christian Bale, who played Batman in The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson, encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics. Bale likened the fan revolt to the backlash that Heath Ledger experienced when he was cast as the Joker in The Dark Knight (2008). To prepare, Pattinson studied Batman's history, reading comics spanning from the Golden Age of Comic Books to writer Tom King's 2016\u20132019 run on Batman. He trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu with instructor Rigan Machado, wanting to undergo physical change in a similar way to superhero actors like Chris Hemsworth, Dwayne Johnson, Robert Downey Jr., and Chris Evans. He received advice from the Dark Knight Trilogy director Christopher Nolan while working with him on Tenet (2020).\nZo\u00eb Kravitz was cast as Catwoman in October 2019 following a screen test with Pattinson; she had previously voiced the character in The Lego Batman Movie (2017). Casting director Cindy Tolan suggested Kravitz, and Reeves chose her over actresses such as Ana de Armas, Ella Balinska, and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez, who also auditioned for the role, as well as Zazie Beetz, Alicia Vikander, Hannah John-Kamen, and Nathalie Emmanuel. Kravitz was reluctant to join another superhero film after working on X-Men: First Class (2011), but was a fan of the Catwoman character and felt \"connected to her emotionally and also aesthetically\"; she felt that her honesty with Reeves played a large part in her selection, and explained that she wanted Reeves to know what working with her would be like. She provided advice on how to develop Catwoman's character, and began training with instructor David Higgins two months before shooting. Kravitz also studied footage of cats and lions fighting to develop her movements while practicing with stunt coordinator Rob Alonzo. She drew inspiration from \"Year One\" and Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman in Batman Returns (1992).\nJeffrey Wright entered negotiations to portray Gordon in September 2019, and was confirmed to be cast the following month. Wright, who is the first actor of color to portray Gordon in live-action, felt his casting reflected how diverse America has become since Batman's introduction in 1939, and said none of Gordon's qualities \"require that he be white\". In preparation, Wright read Batman comics, including The Long Halloween. He looked to Golden Age comics because he felt there was a \"long arc for Gordon from then until today\", which inspired his performance. He also based his performance on Eric Adams, a police officer who became the mayor of New York City. Mahershala Ali was linked to the role of Gordon but passed on it to prioritize his work on the Marvel Studios film Blade. Jonah Hill initially entered negotiations to play either the Riddler or the Penguin, but exited negotiations after a month. Justin Kroll of Variety reported that Hill wanted $10 million\u2014more than double the amount Pattinson would earn\u2014while Kit reported that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take. Paul Dano was cast as the Riddler in October after Hill exited talks. To prepare, Dano researched serial killers and chose to read this material in public places since he found it disturbing and did not want to read it alone. He used the Beach Boys' founder Brian Wilson, whom he had portrayed in the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, as the basis of his performance, and was also influenced by Nirvana's songs. Reeves wrote the Riddler's character with Dano's portrayal of Wilson in mind. Dano thought about the Riddler's motivations and the sense of power the character feels when wearing a mask, and worked with a mask expert to figure out how to approach the role in costume.\nReeves approached Andy Serkis regarding the role of Alfred during post-production on War for the Planet of the Apes, and he was eager to work with Reeves again. Serkis was cast in November 2019, when Colin Farrell and John Turturro were also cast as the Penguin and Carmine Falcone. Farrell looked to the Godfather character Fredo Corleone for inspiration and worked with dialect coach Jessica Drake to develop the Penguin's voice, while Turturro collaborated with his son Amadeo, who is an editor at DC Comics, and Reeves to develop Falcone and his mannerisms. Turturro drew inspiration from warnings his father gave him about the Mafia as a child growing up in New York City. Other cast members include Jayme Lawson, Peter Sarsgaard, Gil Perez-Abraham, twins Charlie and Max Carver, Rupert Penry-Jones, Jay Lycurgo, and Con O'Neill. Lycurgo, who portrays a criminal, shot his scenes a year before he joined the DC series Titans as Tim Drake. Reeves was unsure if the Joker's appearance would be kept in the theatrical release, or if the actor playing him would be able to reprise the role in the future. Consequently, he felt the actor who played the Joker needed to be \"fearless\". Reeves met with Barry Keoghan, who was eager to accept the offer. The production team attempted to keep Keoghan's role a secret by announcing that he was portraying the \"Year One\" character Stanley Merkel when he was cast in August 2020, but Keoghan's role as the Joker was revealed by his brother online ahead of the film's release.\n\n\n=== Design ===\n\n\n==== Sets and props ====\n\nThe design team began working on the Batcave and Batmobile designs before the script was finished, as Reeves had a clear vision of what The Batman's world would look like and wanted the three to reflect each other. The Batcave was based on the train station beneath New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel and private underground railways in New York City that wealthy families used around the early 1900s. Reeves said this was a way to \"root all these things in things that feel real, but also extraordinary\". The Batcave, a partial set build on the Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, also serves as the foundation of the film's depiction of Wayne Manor, which Reeves described as decaying, representing Batman's uninterest in his family's wealth. The Gotham City Hall set was built in a hangar at Cardington Airfield; the hangar also had a soundproof room that was set up for Dano to record certain Riddler scenes. Eight blocks of Gotham were designed in Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden.\nReeves and production designer James Chinlund envisioned a realistic Gotham City and drew inspiration from various locations, such as Chicago and Pittsburgh. During pre-production, Chinlund had designed virtual sets using virtual reality headsets and showed them to Reeves and Fraser, which allowed them to plan for various logistics for filming in the actual sets depicted in the headsets. He had described it as allowing Reeves to storyboard \"the whole film himself\", with the shots being incorporated into the film. Reeves had used screengrabs from the headset for inspiration when storyboarding the Batmobile chase sequence, explaining \"I set all of these shots basically beforehand, and we made this crazy storyboard that was made of screengrabs from VR, from the lenses we had found. And so it was an incredibly involved process\". Fraser had also said that this had helped the crew plan the positions of the cameras, though he noted that \"VR doesn't give you the emotionality of lenses \u2013 it just gives you the mathematics of the field of view\".\nChinlund took inspiration from David Fincher's films and blended several architectural styles together, such as those of buildings from the 1920s to 1940s. Since the failed economic revivals of Gotham left unfinished architecture, Chinlund \"litter[ed] the skyline with these unfinished skyscrapers\" to show the \"grit up there\". Wayne Tower, which serves as Wayne's mausoleum, was inspired by the Hearst Castle; he described it as baroque, Gothic, and ornate. The Iceberg Lounge's aesthetics were inspired by the works of Robert Moses. Fraser said that Gotham City was inspired by the depiction of cities from Chinatown and that of the New York City streets in Klute. While Fraser chose a \"broader palette, which skewed towards dour and gloom\", Chinlund chose to use a different color palette when designing Selina Kyle's residence in the red-light district. He was inspired by Wong Kar-Wai's films and called it a \"romantic palette in some of those movies that we loved, like neon and a lot of colour from the light in the street. Our world is grim in a lot of places, and that was an environment where we could let some colour pop\".\nReeves envisioned a grounded, handmade design for the Batmobile, with Chinlund and concept artist Ash Thorp designing the vehicle's engine to resemble a bat. Reeves wanted the Batmobile to feel like a \"wild beast\" and move away from the tank-like design popularized by Nolan's Dark Knight films in favor of one that looked like a muscle car. He looked to Stephen King's novel Christine (1983), which is about a car possessed by supernatural forces, for inspiration: \"I liked the idea of the car itself as a horror figure, making an animalistic appearance to really scare the hell out of the people Batman's pursuing\". Reeves and Chinlund wanted the Batmobile to feel like its own character, and Chinlund prioritized function which reflected Batman's \"single-minded focus on the mission\". Chinlund used a steel bumper for the frame, so Batman could \"push his way through any obstacle\", as well as the roof of a 1969 Dodge Charger; he left the back open since it did not require protection. Four Batmobile units were built, with the primary driving unit powered by a 650bhp Chevrolet V8 engine constructed from over 3000 machined parts, and the other units equipped with gimbals, water dispensers, and an electronic version for usability. Another unit was built on a Tesla chassis for indoor and night shots.\n\n\n==== Batsuit ====\nThe Batsuit was designed by supervisor Dave Crossman and concept artist Glyn Dillon over a year, with two guiding concepts: it needed to \"look the part\", balancing light and dark while not detracting from Pattinson's emotion, and it had to be flexible; Pattinson wanted to be able to move and fight in it, inspired by the depiction of Batman in the Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight storyline \"Shaman\" (1989) by O'Neil and Edward Hannigan. Pattinson also asked Bale for advice during the design process, and he jokingly advised to \"make sure you're gonna be able to relieve yourself\" while wearing the suit. The team took scans of Pattinson's body while he was filming Tenet and used them in reference to concept art drawn by Dillon. They printed out a rough copy of each element after refining it using digital software before it was molded by supervising costume effects modeler Piere Bohmaned. Further modifications were made to each piece until Reeves examined the final suit for approval. The team created over twenty suits for use in filming. The final suit is more flexible than previous Batsuits, to the point that Pattinson \"immediately started doing somersaults in it just because you could\" when he put on the first prototype.\nReeves wanted the Batsuit to feel as if Batman used spare parts to create it on his own, and the production team sought to evoke the iconography of the comics and balance the Batsuit's darkness without making it difficult to see. Details like bloodstains, nicks, and ricochets from bullets were added, and the color was chosen after consultation with Reeves, cinematographer Greig Fraser, and the costume team. The team used different shades of dark gray for the body armor with some green and yellow coloring; Crossman noted that the grays allowed Batman to be more visible. Batman's utility belt was changed from yellow to black since the team felt it was more practical and realistic. The design team looked to tactical gear from the Vietnam War for inspiration. Particular inspiration came from Lee Bermejo's art in comics like No\u00ebl (2011) and Damned (2018\u201319), as Reeves was impressed by Bermejo's riot gear\u2013esque design while reading Damned, which he felt suited the realistic tone. Bermejo was not consulted regarding the design but was proud to see a Batsuit similar to his in a film.\nThe cowl was printed after being sculpted digitally and was created from polyurethane rubber, and it was intended to resemble leather; the stitching around the forehead and the nose patches were influenced by Adam West's costume from the 1960s Batman television series. Dillon added that he wanted Batman to feel like the \"Grim Reaper\" with a skull-like cowl. The cape was created using artificial Japanese leather, as it was impractical to use real leather due to its weight. Batman's wingsuit was created by a Seattle\u2013based wingsuit company using the Batsuit material. The boots were inspired by Austrian combat boots while Ian Jones, the costume prop maker, added a leather gaiter on top to embellish fight scenes and scenes when Batman rides a motorbike. A special port was also added to the Batsuit towards the end of filming by the costume prop department to aid a scene in which Batman injects himself with adrenaline. Batman's grapple gun, which can slide out via a hidden contraption in his arm, was influenced by Travis Bickle's gun from Taxi Driver (1976). The bat symbol on his chest also serves as a knife; Dillon felt it was unrealistic for the symbol to be leather, so the team decided to make it a weapon.\n\n\n==== Other costumes ====\nCostume design was led by Jacqueline Durran. Makeup artist Maria Donne modeled Bruce Wayne's hairstyle after Cobain, while his eyeliner when suiting up as Batman featured a mix of pigments and products that would sustain rain and sweating. Catwoman's costume was designed to lay a foundation for what would become her comic book outfit while feeling \"as practical as possible\". The facial prosthetics that Keoghan used to portray the Joker were designed by makeup artist Mike Marino; although the Joker only appears in silhouette in the final cut, Reeves still had Marino develop a full design. Reeves wanted him to resemble Conrad Veidt's The Man Who Laughs (1928) character Gwynplaine that inspired the Joker's original portrayal in the comics. Reeves made the Joker's perpetual grin the result of a biological condition, rather than a facial scar as in previous films, to distinguish the new incarnation. The Riddler's costume was based on sketches of the Zodiac Killer; it retains the character's traditional green coat while adding a combat mask, which Dano wanted to show that the Riddler \"probably felt a lot of shame or self-hatred or pain\". Dano also covered himself in plastic wrap since he felt the Riddler would take extreme precautions to avoid leaving DNA at crime scenes. He became concerned about the effect this costume was having on him during filming since his head was \"throbbing with heat\" and described it as feeling compressed from a combination of heat, sweat, and a lack of oxygen.\nTo portray the Penguin, Farrell wore prosthetics and a fat suit created by Marino. Reeves described it as \"almost like a throwback Warner Bros. gangster\" similar to actors John Cazale, Sydney Greenstreet, and Bob Hoskins. Farrell chose to wear a fat suit over gaining weight because he had suffered health problems when he gained weight for the television series The North Water (2021). Farrell's costume does not feature the Penguin's traditional monocle and top hat, and Warner Bros. disallowed him from smoking tobacco as he does in the comics. Farrell fought to allow him to carry a cigar instead of cigarettes, but Warner Bros. would not relent. Farrell was frequently described as \"unrecognizable\" in costume, to the point that Wright and Penry-Jones initially did not recognize him on set. Reeves was hesitant to make Farrell unrecognizable, as he wanted the Penguin's design to reflect the realistic tone, but accepted the design after seeing makeup tests. It took between two and four hours to apply the prosthetics, and Farrell tested the costume at a Burbank Starbucks where he \"got a couple of stares\" ordering a latte in-character. He described wearing the costume as \"absolute liberation\", adding, \"When the piece moves as well as the piece that was designed for the Penguin moved, my eyebrows moved to my cheeks and my smile, it was fucking insane. I didn't have any fear that Colin could be seen through\".\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography began in January 2020 in London, under the working title Vengeance. Reeves announced that filming had wrapped on March 13, 2021, which was a year after it was suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic, and production officially concluded on March 21. Second unit filming took place in December 2019. Greig Fraser served as cinematographer; he previously worked with Reeves on Let Me In (2010). Cemetery scenes were filmed at the Glasgow Necropolis in Scotland in mid-February 2020, before relocating to Liverpool in March. Filming in London took place at the O2 Arena, Printworks nightclub, Kingsway tramway subway, the Two Temple Place, the Somerset House, and areas near the River Thames. Filming in Liverpool took place at St George's Hall, Anfield Cemetery, Walker Art Gallery, Wellington Square, County Sessions House, and the Royal Liver Building. One scene was filmed at the abandoned Hartwood Hospital in Shotts, Scotland, while some exterior shots and stunts were filmed in Chicago.\nFraser used digital capture on Arri Alexa LF cameras, with custom ALFA anamorphic lenses. The film was finished by being printed onto negative film stock and then transferred to an interpositive and transferred back to digital to give the image film grain and texture. Fraser cited cinematographer Gordon Willis's lighting work on Klute, The Godfather, and All the President's Men, and took inspiration from photographer Todd Hido, and at Reeves' suggestion attempted to convey the film from Batman's point of view. He described shooting the film as \"one of the most challenging lighting jobs I've ever done\"; filming Pattinson in the Batsuit was particularly difficult since he did not want shadows to obscure the costume's details. Pattinson broke his wrist performing a stunt towards the beginning of production, and described feeling \"very much alone\" while filming due to the insular nature of nighttime filming and his inability to take off his costume off-set. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) provided the StageCraft virtual production technology that Fraser helped develop on the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian, with a wall of LED panels allowing visual effects backgrounds to be rendered in real-time via Unreal Engine 4. The wall was built around existing practical sets; it was used for scenes involving the abandoned skyscraper where the Bat-Signal is stationed so Reeves and Fraser could film with consistent golden hour lighting, which is difficult when shooting on-location. Using virtual production also meant the lighting impacted the actors and set in a way that green screen technology could not. Reeves was inspired by the lighting from In the Mood for Love (2000). The production team only had a few weeks to shoot the scenes.\nReeves was a meticulous director and described The Batman as the \"most intricate narrative\" he worked on up to that point. Pattinson said Reeves asked for many retakes and adjusting to such an approach took some time. Kravitz described Reeves as \"the most specific person and director I've ever worked with\", citing a particular instance in which he told her not to close her mouth since he thought it needed to be open to convey a certain emotion. Reeves showed the different takes to the actors after filming to illustrate the \"make-or-break nuances\" he had seen. One scene, in which Batman and the Riddler communicate via videotelephony, took over 200 takes. Pattinson guessed that Reeves was \"editing the entire movie, every single take\", which Reeves said was correct and not something that other actors he had worked with had observed. Reeves developed this style of filming, in which he spent more time on fewer angles, while directing the television series Felicity. Reeves filmed fake scenes with Keoghan portraying Merkel to prevent his actual role from leaking, and during the Joker scenes, Reeves kept Keoghan's face out of focus to signify that the Joker was still in his formative stages. The production team briefly discussed removing the subplot in which the Riddler's online followers attempt to assassinate Bella Re\u00e1l due to its similarities to the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which occurred during the final months of filming, but Reeves decided it was too integral to the story and different enough from the attack.\nFor fight scenes, Reeves wanted to depart from the \"kinetic, quick-cutting\" sequences that previous Batman directors like Tim Burton and Nolan had shot. He wanted viewers to \"actually see what's happening... in a way that is utterly convincing\". The Batmobile chase scene's cinematography was inspired by the car chase scene in The French Connection. Reeves originally planned to film the scene on a Liverpool freeway, but instead filmed it at the Dunsfold Aerodrome after determining that a race track would allow for more control. Parts were also filmed at the Coryton Refinery. A camera car with a 360-degree \"hydra\"-like rig attached was used to capture background plate shots. The shot in which the Batmobile jumps through the fire was done practically, though the fireballs were enhanced in post-production. The interior shots of the Penguin's car rolling were achieved with a rotisserie rig on a rotating gimbal attached to the car that Farrell was in. To convey the chase from Batman's perspective, Fraser attached \"cameras to cars and motorbikes, even though it was technically really hard to do... We fought against logistics. We fought against time. We fought against everything that told us to not do it that way\". Fraser used different camera lenses and covered them in silicone to simulate rain and dirt and immerse the viewer.\n\n\n==== Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ====\nProduction was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning two months after filming started. When the pandemic began, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting, unlike other major studios. However, it eventually did so on March 14, 2020. Warner Bros. stated that the hiatus would just be for two weeks, but Reeves announced on March 25 that filming had been suspended indefinitely. Production was unlikely to restart until at least mid-May, and in April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back to October 1, 2021. On March 31, the production's dialect coach, Andrew Jack, died of complications from COVID-19. Around a quarter of filming was completed before the suspension, and Reeves began looking over that footage to help plan for the rest of filming. Reeves did not rewrite the script but used the time to explore the film's tone. On May 12, the UK government said high-end film productions could resume shooting as soon as employers put COVID-19 safety measures in place. A month later, The Batman was given permission to restart production in July at the earliest. Clark said Jack's death haunted the crew as they prepared to resume production.\nBy September 3, filming had resumed for three days at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, only to be put on pause again after Pattinson tested positive for COVID-19. The filming crew then entered a two-week quarantine, after which filming was set to resume, while construction on the sets and props at Leavesden Studios continued. Following this, Reeves became concerned that he would be unable to finish the film if he contracted COVID-19, so he wore a mask, scuba goggles, and a head covering on set. Pattinson stated that approximately 90% of the film was shot in the studio. Filming resumed on September 17, after Pattinson was cleared to return to set. At this point, the film had approximately three more months of filming and was expected to finish by the end of 2020. Filming was limited to England, and crew members were required to live close to the production area and not leave the surrounding community until production ended. Pattinson compared filming during the pandemic to a \"military operation\", saying the cast and crew used earpieces to communicate directions and limit the number of interactions. Some scenes were filmed using a remote control camera, which Pattinson found strange since he could not tell if there were any crew members around. Kravitz added that production became \"impersonal\" since mask mandates and other precautions meant the crew could not interact much. In early October, the film's release was pushed to March 4, 2022, due to the production delays. Certain Riddler scenes, such as the interrogation scene, were originally intended to be filmed towards the end of production but were filmed early due to the pandemic.\n\n\n=== Editing ===\nThe editing for The Batman  was challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After production wrapped in 2021, the post-production team was set up on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California. Hula Post set up the workflow, installing nine Avid editing systems. Due to the strict COVID protocols the studio put in place, editors William Hoy and Tyler Nelson could not sit with Reeves side by side, which was how they were accustomed to working. The solution was to set Reeves up in a separate room with the ability to mirror what was on both editors' Avids, their assistant editors as well as other members of the team. Reeves was given a non-working Avid with a mixing board, a 5.1 surround sound setup, a 65 in (1,700 mm) OLED playback monitor, and desktop screen playbacks which imitated Reeves looking over the shoulders of Hoy and Nelson. According to Hula Post's Senior Support Engineer, James Tejada, this environment was created so the entire editing team could work collaboratively and see each other's playbacks using additional hardware. Two Mac Minis hooked into a local NEXIS network allowed Reeves to be able to do multiple screen shares with the addition of a video switcher to provide access to outputs from any Avid used by the entire editing team. It was the first time such a unique dynamic was deployed. The Batmobile chase was the first scene that sound editor Will Files worked on, and he used a bottle rocket sound effect as the basis for how the car sounded. Files worked with Douglas Murray and Andy Nelson to complete the sequence. The Batmobile's main engine noise came from a Ford big block engine, while the supercharger sound effect was a reversed World War II Jeep recording.\nWarner Bros. held test screenings in late 2021; some early screenings showed a four-hour-long cut. Test audiences were not told they were seeing The Batman until entering the theater. The first cut was longer than Reeves intended, and he described it as rough, saying, \"I was not all the way through the cut of the movie. There was so much of the movie yet to be touched\". Reeves was \"terrified\" going into the first test screening, but was relieved when test audiences enjoyed the complex narrative. He felt it \"kind of validated that this was a direction that an audience would be excited about\", and future test screenings were met with improving reception. Reeves then progressed through the cut and made minor adjustments to ensure that small details were made clear. Later test screenings showed two cuts, with an unknown actor, possibly Keoghan, included in only one. The final screening took place during the week beginning November 29, after which Warner Bros. executives decided which cut they preferred. Reeves kept the penultimate scene\u2014in which the Joker befriends the Riddler in Arkham\u2014because he felt it heightened the stakes of Batman and Catwoman's final conversation while completing the Riddler's story arc, but he cut the Manhunter-inspired scene for being unnecessary and disrupting the pacing. The final cut runs at 176 minutes including credits, making The Batman the longest Batman film and the third-longest superhero film after Zack Snyder's Justice League and Avengers: Endgame (2019).\nIn January 2022, The Batman received a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association, despite wide speculation and internal discussions at Warner Bros. that its somber tone and violent content would lead to it being the first theatrical Batman film with an R-rating. The film was able to receive a PG-13 rating because it does not include excessive profanity or nudity. Rebecca Rubin of Variety opined that an R-rating could have hurt the film's box office potential by preventing many young males from seeing it, noting that the two previous R-rated DC films, Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2021), both underperformed commercially. Reeves said that he always intended to make The Batman PG-13 and that there was not an alternate R-rated cut. He added that a PG-13 rating was one of the only studio mandates he faced.\n\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nDan Lemmon served as the visual effects supervisor, after previously collaborating with Reeves on the Planet of the Apes films. Visual effects vendors included W\u0113t\u0101 FX, ILM, Scanline VFX, and Crafty Apes, with over 1,500 visual effects shots created on a $20 million budget. According to Lemmon, ILM had done work with Gotham, and its StageCraft group handled rendering LED backgrounds in real-time during production. Moreover, Scanline VFX handled most of the third act and complex simulations, W\u0113t\u0101 FX did the Batmobile chase with other standalone environments, and Crafty Apes performed significant work with 2D and fixing issues. Chinland designed the Gotham cityscape so it could be created digitally by ILM and displayed in the background of scenes using the StageCraft technology. He used plate shots from London, New York, and Chicago; according to Lemmon, Reeves wanted the cityscapes to capture the \"forms, architecture, and the fabric of the city to look like it was really in decay\". Chinland originated the idea to place the Bat-Signal on an abandoned building rather than on top of the GCPD building. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a majority of the buildings were created using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Lemmon stated that using Unreal Engine to render the LED-walls in real time helped the team plan logistics for production, such as \"how big the sets needed to be, where process screens would go, what the extensions would look like through the camera, where stunt rigging and special effects equipment would go\" and allowing Fraser to adjust lighting. Portable LED screens showing advertisements were used when filming scenes in Gotham Square to augment the lighting of the jumbotrons in post-production.\nW\u0113t\u0101 FX created over 320 VFX shots for the film. They had begun contacting Lemmon and Warner Bros. about working on the film by the middle of 2019. Anders Langlands, the visual effects supervisor for W\u0113t\u0101, had already traveled to the UK by December 2019 to see pre-production work. While they were initially planned to be on set during filming, this did not happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Langlands had said that W\u0113t\u0101 worked on the film for over a year and that the team managed to do a \"great job in getting everybody set up for that very quickly and it was actually a very, very smooth transition\". For the Batmobile chase sequence, four vehicles were constructed by special effects supervisor Dominic Tuohy, two of which could be driven via remote control, and portions of the scene were shot practically. W\u0113t\u0101 was then tasked with fleshing out the sequence, using CGI to add rain and vehicles and help form the \"beats\" of the chase, such as Penguin causing a fuel truck explosion. One of W\u0113t\u0101's biggest tasks was replicating Fraser's cinematography, which they performed using the Manuka renderer and virtual cinematography. They also bought glass plates and silicone sealants to replicate Fraser's process of inserting silicone on the lenses. Furthermore, the team, including the compositing staff members Peter Hillman, Ben Morgan, and Beck Veitch, upgraded their tools that performed deep focus effects, allowing them to emulate the bokeh and optical vignetting resulting from Fraser's camera lens.\nThe team found difficulty inserting rain in the Batmobile chase due to rain's physics and oscillation in real life, which they wanted to replicate. They began by creating a rain primitive to adjust the speed and phases of rain oscillation, with supervisor Christos Parliarnos setting the primitive on the Houdini particle system to animate the rain speed. The team also created an adjustable car rig for the camera team to track. The camera team could then adjust the headlights and wheels, allowing the VFX team to have accurate 3D models for each car, thus facilitating the insertion of additional cars during post-production. Other CG parts of the scene included the Batmobile's collision with Penguin's car and Batman's cape and boots. W\u0113t\u0101 designed the entrance of the Batcave to accommodate shots of Bruce's motorcycle; Reeves could not film the scenes due to the size of the sets. They digitally created the space using models provided by the art department and plate shots; it sought to emulate Fraser's lighting, drew inspiration from the Tribune Tower, and inserted bats. Additionally, W\u0113t\u0101 used CG to create higher balconies and windows for the City Hall set, as the practical set ended at the first balcony. The team experienced difficulty compositing the CGI architecture to the practical due to distortion and focus falloff caused by the lenses. In fight scenes, the team replaced stunt double Rick English's face with Pattinson's using paintings and facial animations.\nScanline VFX created over 217 VFX shots across 11 sequences. It was responsible for creating the destruction of the water dams, the subsequent tsunami rushing towards Gotham Square Gardens, and Catwoman's burglary. For the burglary, the team used digital doubles for Pattinson and Kravitz and facial replacements for footage filmed with stunt doubles. A CGI arena was created for the Gardens so that cameras could be placed anywhere on set; its exterior was based on scans and plate shots of exterior locations in Chicago and the Madison Square Garden, while the ground level and entrance were based on the O2 Arena. The overall arena set was the only one that used blue screens, with principal photography from O2 being used to create the backgrounds. Simulations were used to replicate water, architectural destruction, fire, smoke, and electric arcing for the final act, with Houdini being used for rigid body simulations and Flowline for water simulations. The artists began by creating low-resolution simulations and progressively animating it faster, using footage of tsunamis as reference. They did not have to significantly adjust the lighting and mainly focused on color-correcting the water. Practical explosions were modified with CGI, while other modifications included environmental interactions, such as fire lighting, smoke, and shockwaves generating dust and dirt. Rendering glass during the explosion of the Gotham Square Gardens roof was difficult due to the \"pings, reflections, and refractions\", while scenes involving arcing electricity from disconnected cables and rafter beams from the interior of Gotham Square Gardens required \"significant art direction\". The team also performed set extensions from practical sets and reconstructed them using plate photography for action scenes located in the rafters. They used Eyeline Studios' volumetric capture tools to replace the stunt doubles' faces. Additional setups were created to match Fraser's process of inserting caulk on the lenses, while crowds were inserted using CGI.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator Michael Giacchino would be composing the film's score. Later that month, Giacchino said he had already finished writing the main theme for the film because he was so excited to do so; because this music was written much earlier in the production than is usual for a film, Giacchino and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he felt total freedom to write the music that he wanted for the film, agreeing with Reeves that this was their vision of Batman similar to how different comic book and graphic novel authors and artists over the years had been able to create different takes on the character. Giacchino completed the score in October 2021, and his main theme was released as a single on January 21, 2022. Giacchino's theme for the Riddler was released as a single on February 4, and his Catwoman theme was released as the third and final single on February 17. The full soundtrack album was released on February 25. \"Something in the Way\" by Nirvana appears twice in the film, and was noted to have a similar bassline to Giacchino's score. He acknowledged this but said it was a lucky coincidence. \"Ave Maria\" by Franz Schubert is also featured and was performed by the Tiffin Boys' Choir and Dano.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\nReeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage of Pattinson in his Batman costume on February 13, 2020. The footage included early music written by Giacchino, and generated discussion about the film's approach to Batman. Chris Evangelista of /Film thought Pattinson's Batman looked much different from previous film depictions, while Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter identified the costume's various references to past incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest resembled a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in his origin story. The footage's use of the color red also led to discussions of how The Batman would differ tonally from previous adaptations. On March 4, Reeves released an image of the film's Batmobile. Dino-Ray Ramos of Deadline Hollywood opined that it seemed \"sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\", giving off \"James Bond-meets-Fast and Furious energy\" that seemed appropriate for Pattinson's version of the character.\nReeves debuted a teaser trailer during the virtual DC FanDome event on August 22, featuring a remix of the Nirvana song \"Something in the Way\" (1991) combined with Giacchino's score. The trailer received 34 million views within 24 hours, and according to CNET's Bonnie Burton and Jennifer Bisset it \"set the internet on fire\". They noted its somber, grim tone. Katrina Nattress of Spin and John Saavedra at Den of Geek respectively described its depiction of Gotham City as \"dystopic\" and \"nightmarish\". Adam Chitwood of Collider praised what he saw as a \"genuinely refreshing\" approach to depicting the world of Batman, and Saavedra wrote that it made The Batman look more like a detective story than a superhero film. Alex Abad-Santos of Vox felt the film had more in common with the R-rated Batman spin-off Joker (2019) than other contemporary DC films. Abad-Santos also noted that some critics disliked the trailer's dark tone, as previous Batman films were similarly dark and \"some aren't in the mood to watch all that darkness over again\", but felt The Batman could show that \"carte-blanche reactionary violence, retribution rewarded with material wealth, and a soulless existence driven by bloody, bone-snapping ambition isn't actually something regular people want to emulate\".\nReeves and Pattinson discussed the film at the Warner Bros. CinemaCon panel on August 24, 2021, where a sizzle reel of new footage was shown. Reeves, Pattinson, and Kravitz debuted a second trailer as the finale of DC FanDome on October 16. Daniel Chin at The Ringer said the trailer had been a highly anticipated part of the virtual event, and felt it did not disappoint. He and other commentators highlighted the trailer's dark, violent, and brutal approach to the character, which Chin felt was consistent with the teaser trailer. Adam B. Vary of Variety specifically compared the tone to Christoper Nolan's \"gritty\" Dark Knight films, believing The Batman would be darker and more violent than even those films. Vary, Chin, and Entertainment Weekly's Chancellor Agard all highlighted the trailer's footage of Farrell and his physical transformation for the role of Penguin. A Japanese trailer released on December 12 quickly led to discussion and speculation that the Joker would appear after fans spotted a figure resembling the character on a newspaper prop in the footage.\nWarner Bros. launched a viral marketing campaign in December 2021 with the website www.rataalada.com (Rata alada is Spanish for \"winged rat\"). The website allows users to engage in simulated conversations with the Riddler, and solving his riddles unlocks promotional artwork. The final reward for the website was the deleted scene where Batman meets with Keoghan's Joker in Arkham. A third trailer, titled \"The Bat and the Cat\", was released on December 27 and focuses on the relationship between Batman and Catwoman. /Film's Jeremy Mathai already felt the film's marketing had been great and was impressed that this was \"yet another incredible trailer\". Asha Barbaschow and Rob Bricken of Gizmodo opined that Pattinson looked like a better Batman than his predecessors, Bale and Affleck. They were intrigued by the trailer's implication that the Riddler would position himself as an \"agent of justice\" and were excited at the prospect of Reeves altering Batman's origin story. A prequel novel, Before the Batman: An Original Movie Novel, was written by David Lewman and released on February 1, 2022. It explores the origins of Batman and the Riddler. More footage from the film was released later that month as part of a teaser for Warner Bros.' 2022 slate of DC films, which at that time included Black Adam, The Flash, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. In March, Reeves announced The Riddler: Year One, a prequel comic book published bimonthly through DC's adult-oriented Black Label imprint beginning in October 2022. The six-issue limited series was written by Dano and illustrated by Stevan Subic.\nWarnerMedia spent $135 million promoting the film, including over $28 million on television advertisements and licensed a significant amount of merchandise; it described the promotion as the largest Batman merchandise collection in a decade. Promotion included Hot Wheels toys from Mattel, Lego sets, action figures from McFarlane Toys and Funko, clothing, cosmetics, and Oreo cookies. Warner Bros. partnered with Universal Pictures and the Supercars Championship to adorn a livery inspired by The Batman on the Ford Mustang GT Course Car, while Google, independently from Warner Bros., updated Google Search to display a Bat-Signal Easter egg for Batman-related search queries in February 2022. Warner Bros. Consumer Products and DC Comics partnered with Puma to release a collection of products like footwear, accessories, and apparel featuring Batman, the Batmobile, and Bat emblem. DC Comics published The Batman Box Set, a trade paperback collection featuring a slipcase with art by Jim Lee and the \"Year One\", The Long Halloween, and Ego comics, in March 2022. Additionally, most of DC's March 2022 Batman-related comics feature variant covers based on the film.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\n\nSpecial screenings were held in Paris on February 21, 2022, and in London on February 23, 2022. The Batman's world premiere was held at Lincoln Center in New York City on March 1, 2022, alongside 350 advance IMAX screenings across the United States, ahead of its wide release by Warner Bros. Pictures on March 4. It was originally set for release on June 25, 2021, before it was pushed back to October 1, 2021, and then to March 2022, both times after Warner Bros. adjusted its release schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Batman was the first superhero film to be released in China since Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), after multiple Marvel films were denied releases in 2021. Warner Bros. canceled the Russian release in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe Batman was released for digital download, as well as to stream on HBO Max, on April 18, 2022, a day earlier than announced. It was the first Warner Bros.\u2013distributed film in over a year that did not stream on HBO Max simultaneously with its theatrical release. The film's linear television premiere was on HBO on April 23, followed by physical release on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on May 24. According to Samba TV, the film was streamed by 720,000 American households during its first day of release on HBO Max. It also had the most successful premiere for any film on HBO Max in Latin America. Samba TV reported that by the end of its first week, the movie had been watched by 4.1 million American households. This was higher than the viewership for nearly all day-and-date films released on HBO Max and the second best for a film on the platform during the first week of release, behind Mortal Kombat (2021), which had a viewership of 4.3 million households.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe Batman grossed $369.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $402.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $772.2 million. It is the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2022, as well as the highest-grossing serial killer film. The film's IMAX performance helped raise its overall first-quarter revenues ($60 million) by 55% and its global box office ($173.2 million) by 57% from the same period in 2021. Deadline Hollywood calculated the film's net profit as $177 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2022's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\nIn the U.S. and Canada, The Batman was projected to gross $115\u2013170 million from 4,417 theaters in its opening weekend, and around $330\u2013475 million for its total domestic box office. Tickets for the advance IMAX screenings sold out within a day of going on sale on February 8, 2022. The film made $57 million on its first day in the U.S. and Canada, which included $17.6 million from Thursday night previews and $4 million from Tuesday and Wednesday advanced screenings. It grossed $134 million in its opening weekend, becoming the second pandemic-era film to gross over $100 million in the U.S. and Canada in its opening weekend, after Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). It also became Warner Bros.' highest-grossing pandemic-era film domestically in just three days, surpassing Dune (2021). More than 65% of the audience in the opening weekend was male, while more than 60% were in the age range of 18\u201334 years old. The film grossed $66.5 million in its second weekend, dropping 50% and staying atop the box office. The third weekend saw it gross $36.7 million, a fall of 45%, while also making it the second film in the pandemic era to make more than $300 million in the U.S. and Canada. In the fourth weekend it was displaced to the second spot by The Lost City, earning $20.5 million for a drop of 44%.\nIn South Korea, The Batman opened to $1.7 million, the biggest opening in the country in 2022. Through March 2, it had earned $5.3 million across eight countries. In France, it earned $2.1 million, the highest opening for 2022. Through March 4, it had made an estimated $54 million in 74 countries outside the U.S. and Canada. In the United Kingdom it opened to $6.4 million, the second-highest opening in the country during the pandemic. It had the second-highest pandemic opening in Spain as well, earning $1.2 million. It grossed around $124.2 million by the end of the week in 74 countries outside the U.S. and Canada, and ranked first in 73 of them during the weekend. It earned $22.3 million globally in IMAX theatres, the second-highest opening weekend for the chain since December 2019. This was also the highest opening for a movie outside the U.S. and Canada in 2022, the highest for Warner in the pandemic era, as well as the third biggest overall during the pandemic. In addition, it had the second-highest opening weekend of the pandemic era in sixteen countries including the United Kingdom ($18.1 million), Mexico ($12.1 million), Australia ($9.3 million), Brazil ($8.8 million), France ($8.4 million), Germany ($5.1 million), South Korea ($4.4 million), Italy ($4.1 million), Spain ($3.7 million), and India ($3.4 million). It also earned the biggest opening weekend for Warner Bros. in 62 countries during the pandemic and its biggest-ever opening weekend in seven countries.\nThe film earned $66.6 million from 76 markets other than the U.S. and Canada in its sophomore weekend for a drop of 42%, including a $3.2 million opening in Japan. The film reached the $500 million-milestone on March 17, becoming the eighth pandemic-era film to do so, while also becoming Warner Bros.' highest-grossing film during the pandemic. In its third weekend, it made $49.1 million in countries other than the U.S. and Canada, a drop of 46%. In China, it opened to a $11.8 million weekend according to Artisan Gateway while 30\u201343% of the theaters were closed, the best opening in the country for an American film in 2022, acquiring the top position at the box office. It grossed $25.3 million during the fourth weekend for a fall of 49%, including $3.1 million in China, where it was displaced by Moonfall. It crossed the $750 million-milestone on April 17, becoming the fifth pandemic-era film to do so, with the largest running-total countries being the United Kingdom ($53.2 million), Mexico ($30.7 million), Australia ($27 million), France ($25.9 million), Brazil ($22.6 million), China ($22.5 million), Germany ($18.9 million), Spain ($11.8 million), Italy ($11.2 million), and Japan ($10 million).\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, The Batman holds an approval rating of 85% based on 523 reviews, with an average of 7.7/10. The site's consensus reads, \"A grim, gritty, and gripping super-noir, The Batman ranks among the Dark Knight's bleakest \u2013 and most thrillingly ambitious \u2013 live-action outings\". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 72 out of 100, based on 68 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it an average of \"A\u2212\" on an A to F scale, while those polled at PostTrak gave it an 87% positive score and 4.5 out of 5 stars, with 71% saying they would definitely recommend it.\nIGN contributor Alex Stedman gave it 10 out of 10, praising its accuracy to the comics, the performances of Pattinson and Kravitz, and the film's production values. He particularly noted the chemistry between Pattinson and Kravitz, calling Kravitz's performance the best in the film. Adam Nayman of The Ringer praised the film's technical aspects and visual style, comparing it favorably to works by Alfred Hitchcock. However, he criticized the final act and found the climax underwhelming, feeling it echoed Joker (2019) too closely. Despite these critiques, Nayman appreciated how the film handled Batman's psychology. Jason Mottram of The National called it \"one of the darkest and most compelling comic-book movies of the modern era\", praising the performances, action, and story, particularly Reeves's portrayal of Penguin and Batman as the \"World's Greatest Detective\".\nDigital Spy reviewer Ian Sandwell highlighted the film's \"film-noir vibes\" and strong production values, praising its focus on Batman as a detective, which he felt justified the runtime. Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent rated it 4/5, praising the visual aesthetic for blending realism with Gothic elements, though she felt the runtime was excessive. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's \"intelligent, emotionally nuanced storytelling\", its exploration of institutional corruption, and its unique Gothic identity, though he wished for more levity. Peter Debruge at Variety admired the film's noir elements and its interrogation of the superhero concept, finding it relevant to contemporary issues. Alex Abad-Santos of Vox appreciated the film's detective-oriented story and exploration of Batman's character.\nHowever, some critics were less enthusiastic. Richard Brody of The New Yorker liked the first two hours but felt the characters were underdeveloped, reducing the impact of the climax. Ann Hornaday from The Washington Post rated it 1.5 out of 4, criticizing its dark visuals, runtime, and reliance on dialogue, although she appreciated Pattinson's performance. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave a negative review, finding the political commentary and tone unvaried, and criticizing the film's length. Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the performances and score but found the dark visuals and exposition overwhelming. Kim Newman of Sight and Sound criticized the film's length and felt the secondary characters were underdeveloped, though he praised the detective aspects and visual elements.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, The Batman received nominations for Best Sound, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Visual Effects. The film's other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards.\n\n\n== Thematic analysis ==\n\n\n=== Class conflict and inequality ===\nClass conflict is a central concept featured in The Batman, with Marco Vito Oddo of Collider asserting that the main theme is social inequality. Three of the primary characters\u2014Batman, the Riddler, and Catwoman\u2014are orphans from different economic backgrounds. Whereas Batman grew up in privilege, the Riddler only knew torment, while Catwoman experienced hardship. The Riddler's frustration with his upbringing leads to him lashing out against the wealthy, reflecting that criminality is born from desperation. JM Mutore of The A.V. Club and Susana Polo of Polygon said the Riddler falls into \"the trap of villains who are right\", opining that he is correct to expose the corruption that has harmed the unfortunate. Chrishaun Baker of Inverse added that the film never frames the Riddler's frustration as wrong, though Brandon Zachary of Comic Book Resources argued that the Riddler is \"inherently wrong\" to think that change can be achieved through violence even if his motivations are understandable.\nZachary wrote that Batman, Catwoman, and the Riddler's upbringings give each character a different worldview: Batman's is narrow and binary, the Riddler adopts a \"bitter and cruel\" method to fight corruption that harms innocents, and Catwoman acknowledges the corrupting power of wealth but only becomes violent when her friends are harmed. The film draws parallels between the three characters, reflecting a popular notion that Batman is similar to his adversaries. Adam Nayman of The Ringer felt the film highlighted the themes of duality between Batman and his foes, and opined that Batman and the Riddler feel like \"secret siblings\" rather than \"two different case studies in forlorn orphan psychology\". Catwoman and the Riddler make Batman realize that poverty and inequality are the roots of Gotham's troubles, and inspire him to become an agent of hope and use his wealth to prevent social inequality. Baker wrote that the film ends with Batman realizing he \"has to fight for the will of the people, amongst the people, against the very same institutions that make hollow promises to protect them\".\n\n\n=== Depiction of Batman ===\nBaker said that previous Batman films tend to reflect right-wing themes, with Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan's adaptations respectively featuring libertarian and \"vaguely authoritarian\" depictions of Batman. The Batman departs by questioning Batman's ethics and focusing on his material wealth. The film highlights that Batman's wealth does not alleviate his suffering and explores the idea that he should be more philanthropic; initially, Batman does not realize he is taking his wealth for granted and could be using it to help Gotham. Mutore felt The Batman was more direct in addressing the issue than previous Batman films, but \"circumvents this argument\" by portraying Thomas Wayne's attempt at philanthropy as only leading to corruption, while Baker felt the film directly addresses the issue by having progressive mayoral candidate Bella R\u00e9al confront Bruce about his wealth. Conversely, Nayman argued the film does not focus on his class as much as previous films did, as he is depicted as a recluse in the film.\nThe Batman also explores grief, trauma, and the \"horror\" of living with post-traumatic stress disorder through Batman. Batman's initial antagonism towards Alfred and apathy towards Catwoman's situation stems from the death of his parents and his inability to communicate with people due to his fear of suffering more emotional pain. His obsession with solving the Riddler case is a method of coping with the trauma of losing his parents, while his obsession with being Batman is the result of channeling his rage into what Marcus Shorter of Bloody Disgusting called a \"dogmatic dedication to his chosen crimefighting craft\". The film ends with Batman realizing that he must process his trauma to help improve Gotham. Batman's relationship with the police differs from previous Batman films. Burton's films depict the police as an incompetent force that Batman supersedes and Nolan's depict them bending the law to assist Batman. The Batman shows Batman having a hostile relationship with Gotham police, who see him as a criminal. Baker said that \"[e]very time Batman interacts with the police, there's a palpable sense of discomfort; to them, Batman represents a level of oversight that they're not used to having to contend with\". Baker called this \"timely\" given the contemporary American sociopolitical context including increased awareness of police brutality.\n\n\n== Future ==\n\n\n=== Shared universe ===\nThe Batman is intended to be the first of a new Batman film trilogy and establish a Batman-focused shared universe separate from the DCEU. Reeves and Clark refer to the shared universe as the \"Batman Epic Crime Saga\". Key cast members had signed on for future films by November 2019. In December 2021, Pattinson said he had ideas for developing Batman's character in further films, while Clark said The Batman would lay a foundation upon which future films would build. Pattinson and Reeves expressed interest in introducing Robin and featuring the Court of Owls, Calendar Man, Mr. Freeze, or Hush as villains in a sequel. By October 2022, Reeves was meeting with directors and writers for several films and television series that were in early development and centered on members of Batman's rogues gallery, such as Scarecrow, Clayface, and Professor Pyg.\n\n\n==== The Penguin (2024) ====\n\nBy September 2021, HBO Max was developing a spin-off series focused on the Penguin, with Lauren LeFranc hired as showrunner. In March 2022, HBO Max ordered The Penguin as a limited series, with LeFranc writing all eight episodes, and Craig Zobel directing the first three. Farrell stars as the Penguin, and executive produces the series alongside Reeves, Clark, LeFranc, and Zobel. The series premiered on HBO on September 19, 2024.\n\n\n==== Sequel ====\nA sequel was announced at CinemaCon in April 2022, with Pattinson and Reeves set to return, along with Tomlin returning by August to co-write the script with Reeves. The sequel was titled The Batman \u2013 Part II in January 2023. Wright, Serkis, and Farrell are set to reprise their respective roles as Gordon, Pennyworth, and the Penguin in the film. Filming is scheduled to begin in April 2025, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in England. The Batman \u2013 Part II is scheduled to be released in the United States on October 2, 2026, after it was delayed from an initial October 2025 release date.\n\n\n==== Unproduced series ====\nIn July 2020, HBO Max gave a series commitment to a police procedural television series centered on the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), with Terence Winter set to write and serve as showrunner. Reeves, Winter, Clark, Daniel Pipski, and Adam Kassan were executive producing the series. In August, Reeves said the series would be a prequel to The Batman, taking place during the first year of Batman's career and focusing on the corruption in Gotham and the GCPD. He said the series would be told from the perspective of one particular crooked cop, with the story being a \"battle for his soul\", taking inspiration from Prince of the City (1981). In November, Winter left the project due to creative differences, and Joe Barton was hired to replace him in January 2021. HBO still had creative issues with the project, especially with its protagonist being a corrupt cop, and they encouraged Reeves to focus on existing comics characters instead. Wright revealed there had been discussions about him appearing in the series but he did not entertain the idea before the film's release.\nIn March 2022, Reeves said the GCPD series was on indefinite hold, though he hoped to revisit the premise in the future. Reeves revealed that initial work on that series had led to work on a new idea based on the Arkham State Hospital. He said the series would build upon Arkham's introduction in the film and explore the origins of different characters related to it. He envisioned a horror tone, with Arkham being depicted as a haunted house. Antonio Campos was hired by then to write and direct the Arkham series in addition to serving as the showrunner and an executive producer, while the GCPD series was still in development. By this time, the pitch for the Arkham series was one of the first to be bought by DC Studios and it was being developed for the DC Universe (DCU), which Gunn revealed in December when he said Reeves would continue developing projects for both his Batman shared universe and the DCU. Both series were no longer moving forward by July 2024, though some elements of the GCPD series were integrated into The Penguin.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nField, James (2022).

            "Batman is a 1943 American 15-chapter theatrical serial from Columbia Pictures, produced by Rudolph C. Flothow, directed by Lambert Hillyer, that stars Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as his sidekick Robin. The serial is based on the DC Comics character Batman, who first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in May 1939. The villain is an original character named Dr. Daka, a secret agent of the Japanese Imperial government, played by J. Carrol Naish. Rounding out the cast are Shirley Patterson as Linda Page, Bruce Wayne's love interest, and William Austin as Alfred, the Wayne Manor butler.\nThe serial's story line involves the Batman, a secret U.S. government agent, attempting to defeat the schemes of Japanese agent Dr. Daka operating in Gotham City at the height of World War II. Serving Daka are his American henchmen.\nBatman is notable for being the first appearance on film of Batman and for debuting story elements that quickly became permanent parts of the Batman character's mythos, such as the Batcave and its secret entrance through a grandfather clock inside Wayne Manor. The serial also changed the course of how Alfred's physical appearance was depicted in future Batman stories. At the time Batman was released in theaters, Alfred was drawn as a portly gentleman in the comics. Subsequent issues suddenly depicted Alfred as slim and sporting a thin moustache, following actor William Austin's appearance.\nThe serial was commercially successful and in 1949, four years after World War II, spawned another Columbia chapter serial, Batman and Robin. The entire first Batman serial was re-released theatrically in 1965 as An Evening with Batman and Robin, and proved very popular (some theatres showed the chapters as a Saturday matinee). Its success inspired the action-comedy lampoon series Batman (and its 1966 theatrical feature film spin-off) starring Adam West and Burt Ward.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Batman/Bruce Wayne (Lewis Wilson), and his ward, Robin/Dick Grayson (Douglas Croft), secret government agents following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, become aware of a Japanese sabotage ring operating in Gotham City. Bruce's girlfriend Linda Page (Shirley Patterson) asks for his help in finding her uncle, Martin Warren (Gus Glassmire), who was abducted by the ring after he was released from prison.\nDr. Tito Daka (J. Carrol Naish), the Japanese leader of the ring, plans to steal the city's radium supply to power his invention, a hand-held ray gun that can dissolve anything hit by its powerful beam. He forces from Warren the location of the vault where the radium is stored. Daka sends his American henchmen, along with a zombie that he controls by microphone via an electronic brain implant, to steal the precious metal. Batman discovers the plot and eventually routs the gang after a terrific battle.\nIn his secret Bat's Cave, the Batman interrogates one of Daka's henchmen, who reveals the radium was to have been taken to The House of the Open Door, located in the mostly deserted \"Little Tokyo\" section of Gotham City. Batman and Robin infiltrate the gang's lair (also Dr. Daka's laboratory), hidden inside a still-open business, a Fun House ride. There, they find Linda bound, gagged, and unconscious. After she is rescued by the Dynamic Duo, Daka transforms her uncle Warren into a zombie, and plots the derailment of a heavily laden supply train. Once again, Dr. Daka's sabotage efforts are stopped by the Batman and Robin.\nTraps and counter-traps follow in the succeeding chapters, as the Dynamic Duo continue to thwart the plans of the Japanese agent and his henchmen. When Dr. Daka attempts to steal America's Victory Plans, the Batman and Robin finally prevail. They oversee the capture of Daka's men and finally the death of the Japanese agent, as he tries to escape and falls through his own hidden trapdoor into a pit full of hungry alligators.\n\n\n== Chapter titles ==\n\nSource:\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLewis Wilson as Bruce Wayne / Batman\nDouglas Croft as Richard \"Dick\" Grayson / Robin\nJ. Carrol Naish as Dr. Tito Daka/Prince Daka\nShirley Patterson as Linda Page\nWilliam Austin as Alfred (uncredited)\nRobert Fiske as Foster (uncredited)\nGus Glassmire as Uncle Martin (uncredited)\nKarl Hackett as Wallace (uncredited)\nTom London as Andrews (uncredited)\nCharles Middleton as Ken Colton (Episodes #6-#8) (uncredited)\nHarry Tenbrook as Bartender (uncredited)\nCharles C. Wilson as Police Captain Arnold (uncredited)\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe serial was made at the height of World War II and, like numerous works of popular American fiction of the time, contains anti-Axis powers sentiments and dialogue reflecting anti-Japanese sentiment. Early narration in the first chapter (at minute 9:20\u20139:30) references the U.S. government policy of Japanese American internment to explain the abandoned neighborhood where Daka's headquarters are located in Little Tokyo in Gotham.\nJust like many other contemporary serials, Batman also suffered from a low budget. No attempt was made to create the Batmobile, so a black 1939 Cadillac Series 61 convertible was used, chauffeured by Alfred when Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson were either in their civilian or Batman and Robin identities. It is driven \"top-up\" when it is the Batmobile, and \"top-down\" when it is Bruce Wayne's car. Batman's hometown of Gotham City, an analog of New York in the comics, becomes an analog of Los Angeles in the film.\nWhile many serials made changes as part of their adaptation, to the extent that they were often 'improved', Batman fared better than most, with minor changes. In this serial special utility belts were worn but never used, the villain was not taken from the comics' stories, there was no Batmobile, and Batman was a secret government agent instead of an independent crime-fighting vigilante. This last change was due to the time period's film censors, who would not allow the hero to be seen taking the law into his own hands.\nSeveral continuity errors occur, such as Batman losing his cape in a fight but wearing it again after the film only briefly cuts away. The opening narration in chapter 1 states that Wayne Manor is in the fictional Gotham City, but his mail in chapter 5 is addressed to Los Angeles. In the first chapter, Batman, when hearing the name of Dr. Daka asks \"who is that?\" Then in the last chapter Batman tells Daka he and other enforcers have been looking for Daka since he killed two agents trying to deport him\u2014an element never mentioned in any earlier chapter. In the transition between chapters 5 and 6, it is unclear how Batman survived the plane crash which killed two villains who were on the plane with him.\nPress releases announced Batman as a \"Super Serial\", and was Columbia's largest-scale serial production to date. The studio gave it a publicity campaign equivalent to a feature film.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical release ===\nBatman was first released to theaters one chapter per week, beginning on July 16, 1943. Columbia re-released it to theaters in 1954 and 1962.\nIn 1964, film buff Hugh Hefner screened all 15 chapters of the serial at the Playboy Mansion. The trendy event received much notice in the press, prompting Columbia to offer the unedited serial to theaters in 1965 as An Evening with Batman and Robin in one long, marathon showing. This re-release was successful enough to inspire the development, by Lorenzo Semple Jr., under the auspices of producers William Dozier and Howie Horwitz), of the 1960s television series Batman. The series starred Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, and was produced as a lampoon, being villain-driven and heavy on the action-comedy.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\n\nA silent abridged version was released in 8 mm and Super 8 formats during the 1960s, with the complete serial edited into six chapters running 10 minutes each. Four, three-minute reels with action scenes were also issued.\nIn the 1970s, the complete 15-chapter serial in its original unaltered format was released in a Super-8 Sound edition.\nIn the wake of the success of Tim Burton's Batman, the serial was released as a two-part VHS series in 1990 by GoodTimes Entertainment in a heavily modified form that dubbed over most of the original dialogue of a racially sensitive nature. Dan Scapperotti of Cinefantastique commented that he was not surprised with those revisions as Columbia came at the time under the ownership by Japan's Sony corporation. Alterations made by Sony were limited to the soundtrack itself, and no frames or scenes were cut. Gary Owens provided a new narration track, while additional lines of a racially sensitive nature were replaced by voice actors bearing little similarity to the original voices.\nIn October 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment unveiled a two-disc DVD of the serial. This release restored the original dialogue but is missing several seconds in Chapter 2, such as the \"Next Chapter\" sequence at the end. The image and sound quality of Sony's set varies; the first episode is an upscale of the previous VHS transfer, but the remainder of the episodes were restored.\nOn February 4, 2014, Mill Creek Entertainment released Gotham City Serials, a two-disc DVD set with both the 1943 serial and the 1949 Batman and Robin serial.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn 1989, the cable network The Comedy Channel aired the Batman serial uncut and uncensored. The cable network American Movie Classics did the same in the early 1990s on Saturday mornings. Turner Classic Movies began airing the serial every Saturday morning beginning in March 2015. Following the conclusion of the last episode, the channel continued the weekly slot with the 1949 Batman and Robin follow-up serial that, following an August hiatus, concluded in November the same year. In June 2021, Turner Classic Movies started airing Batman with one chapter every Saturday morning.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAuthor Raymond Williams Stedman noted in 1971 that the serial \"gained good press notices\" but \"scarcely\" deserved it, going on to describe it as an unintentional farce. Jim Harmon and Donald F. Glut describe Batman as \"one of the most ludicrous serials ever made\" despite its \"forthright\" simplicity.\nThe casting of Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as Robin has been criticized. Some critics felt that the actors and their stunt doubles lacked the \"style and grace\" of their comic-book characters. Critics found Wilson's physique to be unathletic and \"thick about the middle\", and his voice was both too high-pitched and had a Boston accent. Croft was considered too old to play Robin and looked older still when doubled by a \"hairy-legged\" stuntman.\nAlso, the costumes were criticized as unconvincing in execution, and although the Batman costume was based on his original appearance, it draws special criticism for being too baggy and topped by pair of \"devil\" horns.\nWill Brooker remarked in the 2001 Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon that, although he feels that the depiction of the Japanese characters is racist, Batman has little direct contact with them. However, when Batman does in fact finally meet Daka in the final chapter, he immediately exclaims \"Oh, a Jap!\" He soon after calls Daka \"Jap murderer\" and \"Jap devil\" and finally discusses a \"Jap spy ring\". Brooker surmises that these elements are likely to have been added as an afterthought to make the film more appealing to audiences of the time and that creating a nationalistic, patriotic film was not the filmmakers' original intent.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nAn Evening with Batman and Robin was especially popular in college towns, where theaters were booked solid. The success of this re-release led to the creation of the TV series Batman. The breathless opening and closing narration of each chapter in this and other Columbia serials was, to some extent, the model that was parodied in the mid-1960s series.\nThe success of both the re-release and the subsequent TV series prompted the production of The Green Hornet. Originally a radio action crime drama series from 1936 to 1953, it was also the basis of two Universal Pictures movie serials in 1940. The 1966-67 TV show was played as a straight superhero action mystery series, and was also very popular with audiences but lasted only one season, owing to significantly higher production costs. The failure of The Green Hornet led to the belief that similar revivals of serial properties were not possible in the television market of the time, and no further series were produced.\nAt DC Comics, Prince Daka appeared in All-Star Squadron #42-43 (February\u2013March 1985) as the leader of several Japanese super-operatives. Since the #42-43 storyline occurred in 1942, it depicts Daka's activities prior to the events of the 1943 serial, as noted by writer Roy Thomas in a letter column.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, Big John Creations produced a web series called Mystery of the Bat-Man as an homage to the original serial. Six chapters have been released under the guise of a \"lost\" serial from the late 1930s, complete with fictional backstory.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBatman at IMDb\nBatman at Rotten Tomatoes\nBatman at AllMovie\nSerials @ Batman: Yesterday, Today, & Beyond\n\"BATMAN ON FILM\" \u2013 The 40s Serials",
            "New Adventures of Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, also known as simply Batman and Robin, is a 15-chapter serial released in 1949 by Columbia Pictures. It is a sequel to the 1943 serial Batman, although with different actors. Robert Lowery plays Batman, while Johnny Duncan plays Robin. Supporting actors include Jane Adams as Vicki Vale and veteran character actor Lyle Talbot as Commissioner Gordon.\nThe serials were re-released as Video On Demand titles by RiffTrax, the alumni project of former Mystery Science Theater 3000  members Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. As of September 2014, the entire serial has been released. Turner Classic Movies has broadcast the film serial from June to November 2015 and from October 2021 to January 2022 in a weekly half-hour slot on Saturday mornings.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe dynamic duo face off against the Wizard, a hooded villain with an electronic device that remotely controls vehicles and a compulsion to set challenges for Batman and Robin. The Wizard's identity remains a mystery to the caped crusaders until the end.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRobert Lowery as Bruce Wayne / Batman\nJohnny Duncan as Dick Grayson / Robin\nJane Adams as Vicki Vale\nLyle Talbot as Commissioner Jim Gordon\nRalph Graves as Winslow Harrison\nDon C. Harvey as Nolan, a henchman\nWilliam Fawcett as Professor Hammil\nLeonard Penn as Carter, Hammil's valet, and The Wizard, Carter's evil twin\nRick Vallin as Barry Brown, a tabloid radio gossip\nMichael Whalen as Dunne, a private investigator\nLee Roberts as Neal, a henchman (uncredited)\nGreg McClure as Evans, a henchman\nHouse Peters Jr. as Earl, a henchman\nJim Diehl as Jason, a henchman\nRusty Wescoatt as Ives, a henchman\nEric Wilton as Alfred Pennyworth (uncredited)\nGeorge Offerman Jr. as Jimmie Vale, Vicki's brother and henchman (uncredited)\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nBatman and Robin is, according to historians Jim Harmon and Donald Glut, one of several Katzman productions which involved money-saving measures. The Batman costume had a poorly fitting cowl and the Robin costume added pink tights to cover the \"hairy legs\" of both the actor and the stuntman. The Batmobile is again excluded, but instead of a limousine as in the first serial, the duo drive around in a 1949 Mercury.\nSeveral mistakes and failures of logic occur in the serial. One example is that the film shows the Bat-Signal working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, despite the fact that the heroes' utility belts had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an oxy-acetylene torch from his belt to cut through a steel door (the tanks for the torch are not shown); to compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the filmmakers improvised in following the directions for a \"blowtorch\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\nIn the wake of the success of Tim Burton's Batman in 1989, GoodTimes Entertainment released the serial on VHS, splitting the entire serial into two separate, budget-priced tapes recorded in LP mode. The GoodTimes edition was slightly edited, as well, with several minutes of the opening chapter mysteriously cut. In 1997, Columbia TriStar Home Video re-released the uncut serial (in SP mode) as a complete 2-tape VHS set. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the serial on DVD in 2005, timed to coincide with the theatrical release of Batman Begins. Unlike its predecessor, Batman and Robin: The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection has been given a restoration. On February 4, 2014, Mill Creek Entertainment released Gotham City Serials, a two-disc DVD set that includes both the 1943 Batman serial and the 1949 Batman and Robin serial. RiffTrax released a Video On Demand of the first installment of the short on July 16, 2013, featuring a running mocking commentary from Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame. The final episode, \"Batman Victorious\", was released with commentary on September 19, 2014.\n\n\n== Chapter titles ==\nTurner Classic Movies began airing episodes of Batman and Robin in June 2015, following one week after the conclusion of airing the previous 1943 serial.

            "Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero film directed by Sir Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles. The film reboots the Batman film series, telling the origin story of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman and his fight to stop Ra's al Ghul (Neeson) and the Scarecrow (Murphy) from plunging Gotham City into chaos.\nAfter Batman & Robin was panned by critics and underperformed at the box office, Warner Bros. Pictures cancelled future Batman films, including Joel Schumacher's planned Batman Unchained. Between 1998 and 2003, several filmmakers collaborated with Warner Bros. in attempting to reboot the franchise. After the studio rejected a Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon pitched in December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Nolan in January 2003 to direct a new film. Nolan and Goyer began development on the film in early 2003. Aiming for a darker, more realistic tone compared to the previous films, a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience's emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character. The film, which was principally shot in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Chicago, relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects, with computer-generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films. Comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Long Halloween served as inspiration.\nExpectations for Batman Begins ranged from moderate to low, which originated from the poor reception of Batman & Robin that was credited with stalling the Batman film series in 1997. After premiering in Tokyo on May 31, 2005, the film was released on June 15, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, who deemed the film an improvement over the Schumacher films. The film grossed over $371.9 million worldwide, becoming the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2005 and was the second highest grossing Batman film at the time behind Tim Burton's Batman (1989). Receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, the film elevated Bale to leading man status while it made Nolan a high-profile director.\nSince its release, Batman Begins has often been cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s. It was credited for revitalizing the Batman character in popular culture, shifting its tone towards a darker and more serious tone and style. The film helped popularise the term reboot in Hollywood, inspiring studios and filmmakers to revive franchises with realistic and serious tones. It was followed by The Dark Knight (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), with the three films constituting The Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Gotham City, after falling down a well and getting swarmed by bats, a young Bruce Wayne develops a fear of them. At the opera with his parents, Bruce becomes unsettled by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger Joe Chill murders Bruce's parents in front of him. Bruce is raised by the family butler, Alfred Pennyworth.\nFourteen years later, Chill testifies against the mafia crime boss, Carmine Falcone, and is paroled. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but one of Falcone's hitmen does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, Rachel Dawes, berates him for acting outside the justice system. After confronting Falcone, who says real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the world, training in combat, and immersing himself in the criminal underworld.\nIn a Bhutan prison, he is approached by Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. The League believes Gotham is beyond saving and intends to destroy it. After completing his training, Bruce rejects the League and its mandate that killing is necessary. He escapes, burning down their temple in the process. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Intent on fighting crime, Bruce returns to Gotham and takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, which is being taken public by businessman William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox, a friend of Bruce's father, allows him access to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and the Tumbler, an armored vehicle. Bruce poses publicly as a shallow playboy while setting up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor and taking up the vigilante identity of \"Batman,\" inspired by his childhood fear, which he has now conquered.\nIntercepting a drug shipment, Batman provides Rachel, now a Gotham Assistant District Attorney, with evidence against Falcone and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest police officers, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychologist who smuggled drugs into Gotham with his help. Donning a scarecrow mask, Crane sprays Falcone with a fear-inducing hallucinogen, driving him insane and transferring him to Arkham Asylum. While investigating Crane, Batman is ambushed by him and sprayed with the hallucinogen. Batman barely escapes and is saved by Alfred and Fox, who develop an antidote for the hallucinogen.\nWhen Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, he reveals he has introduced his drug into Gotham's water supply and drugs her with the hallucinogen. Batman later subdues Crane and sprays him with his own chemical. While being interrogated, Crane claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety and administers the antidote. He gives her two vials: one for Gordon and the other for mass production. At Bruce's birthday party, Ducard reappears and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him. Ra's loads the emitter onto Gotham's monorail train to release the drug at the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and reveals his identity to her. He confronts Ra's on the train as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman escapes the train and leaves Ra's to die as it crashes.\nBruce gains Rachel's respect. However, she refuses to be with him, promising they can be together when Gotham no longer needs Batman. Batman becomes a public hero. After purchasing a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, Bruce fires Earle and replaces him with Fox. Sergeant Gordon is promoted to Lieutenant, shows Batman the Bat-Signal, and tells him about a criminal who leaves behind Joker playing cards. Batman promises to look into it and disappears into the night.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nChristian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman:A billionaire socialite who, after witnessing his parents' death in a mugging at age 8, travels around the world seven years before returning home to inherit his family company Wayne Enterprises whilst operating at night as a bat-masked vigilante bringing justice upon the criminal underworld of Gotham City. Bale was relatively unknown when cast. Before he was confirmed on September 11, 2003, having expressed interest in the role since Darren Aronofsky was planning his own film adaptation, Eion Bailey, Henry Cavill who later be cast as Superman, Billy Crudup, Hugh Dancy, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joshua Jackson, David Boreanaz, Heath Ledger, who later played the Joker in The Dark Knight, and Cillian Murphy, who would later be cast as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow, took interest in it as well. Josh Hartnett met with Nolan about the role, but decided against pursuing it. Bale, Bailey and Murphy auditioned using the Batman Forever sonar suit donated by Val Kilmer, but the cape was lost, and Amy Adams served as the casting reader for the casting of Bruce Wayne / Batman in a favor to the casting director. Bale felt the previous films underused Batman's character, overplaying the villains instead. To best pose as Batman, Bale studied graphic novels and illustrations of the superhero. Director Nolan said of Bale, \"He has exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.\" Goyer stated that while some actors could play a great Bruce Wayne or a great Batman, Bale could portray both radically different personalities. Since he had lost a great deal of weight in preparation for his role in The Machinist, Bale hired a personal trainer to help him gain 100 pounds (45 kg) of muscle in the span of only a couple of months to help him physically prepare for the role. After realizing he went over by 30 pounds (14 kg), he lost the excess weight by the time filming began. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie.\nGus Lewis as Young Bruce Wayne.\nMichael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth:A trusted butler to Bruce's parents, who continues his loyal service to their son after their deaths as his closest confidant. Nolan offered the role to Anthony Hopkins but he declined. Nolan went to Caine's country home to personally deliver him the script, telling what his role would be and describing Alfred as \"Batman's godfather\". Nolan felt Caine would effectively portray the foster father element of the character. Although Alfred is depicted in the film as having served the Wayne family for generations, Caine created his own backstory, in that before becoming Wayne's butler, Alfred served in the Special Air Service. After being wounded, he was invited to the position of the Wayne family butler by Thomas Wayne because, \"He wanted a butler, but someone a bit tougher than that, you know?\"\nLiam Neeson as Henri Ducard / Ra's al Ghul: The leader of the League of Shadows, an ancient society that uses chaos to punish the corrupt and decadent, who goes undercover as an associate of the League and trains Bruce in martial arts, later revealing himself in the film's climax. Writer David Goyer said he felt he was the most complex of all the Batman villains, comparing him to Osama bin Laden; \"He's not crazy in the way that all the other Batman villains are. He's not bent on revenge; he's actually trying to heal the world. He's just doing it by very draconian means.\" Gary Oldman was first choice for the part, but ended up playing James Gordon instead. Guy Pearce, who collaborated with Christopher Nolan on Memento (2000), reported that the pair had discussions about him playing the role, but both of them decided that he was too young for the part. Viggo Mortensen was also considered for the role. Neeson is commonly cast as a mentor, so the revelation that his character was the main villain was intended to shock viewers.\nKatie Holmes as Rachel Dawes: Bruce's childhood friend and love interest who serves as Gotham City's assistant district attorney and fights against corruption in the city of Gotham. Nolan found a \"tremendous warmth and great emotional appeal\" in Holmes, and also felt \"she has a maturity beyond her years that comes across in the film and is essential to the idea that Rachel is something of a moral conscience for Bruce\".\nEmma Lockhart as Young Rachel Dawes.\nGary Oldman as James \"Jim\" Gordon:One of the few uncorrupted Gotham City police officers, who is on duty the night of the murder of Bruce's parents and, in this way, shares a special bond with the adult Bruce and thus with Batman. Oldman was Nolan's first choice for Ra's al Ghul, but when Chris Cooper turned down the part of Gordon to spend time with his family Nolan decided that it would be refreshing for Oldman, who is renowned for his portrayals of villains, to play the role instead. \"I embody the themes of the movie which are the values of family, courage and compassion and a sense of right and wrong, good and bad and justice,\" Oldman said of his character. He filmed most of his scenes in Britain. Goyer said Oldman heavily resembled Gordon as drawn by David Mazzucchelli in Batman: Year One.\nCillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow: A corrupt psychopharmacologist working as Chief Administrator of Arkham Asylum. A specialist in the psychology of fear, he has secretly created a fear-inducing toxin and plots with Ra's al Ghul to expose the entire Gotham population. Nolan decided against casting an Irish actor like Murphy for Batman, before casting him as Scarecrow. Murphy read numerous comics featuring the Scarecrow and discussed making the character look less theatrical with Nolan. Murphy explained, \"I wanted to avoid the Worzel Gummidge look, because he's not a very physically imposing man \u2013 he's more interested in the manipulation of the mind and what that can do.\"\nTom Wilkinson as Carmine Falcone:The most powerful Mafia boss in Gotham, who shares a prison cell with Joe Chill after he murdered Bruce's parents. Later, after having Chill murdered for his decision to testify against their relationship, he goes into business with Dr. Jonathan Crane and Ra's al Ghul by smuggling in Crane's fear toxins through his drug shipments over the course of several months so that they can be mixed in with the city's water supply.\nRutger Hauer as William Earle:The CEO of Wayne Enterprises, who takes the company public in Bruce's long-term absence.\nKen Watanabe as decoy Ra's al Ghul:A member of the League of Shadows assigned to impersonate Ra's al Ghul during Bruce's training.\nMorgan Freeman as Lucius Fox:A high-ranking Wayne Enterprises employee demoted to working in the company's Applied Science Division, where he conducts advanced studies in biochemistry and mechanical engineering and supplies Bruce with much of the gear necessary to carry out Batman's mission. He is promoted to CEO when Bruce takes control of the company by the end of the film.\nOther cast members include Mark Boone Junior as Arnold Flass, Gordon's corrupt partner; Linus Roache as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's late father; Larry Holden as district attorney Carl Finch; Colin McFarlane as Gillian B. Loeb, the police commissioner; Christine Adams as Jessica, William Earle's secretary; Vincent Wong as an old Asian prisoner; Sara Stewart as Martha Wayne, Bruce's late mother; Richard Brake as Joe Chill, the Waynes' killer; Gerard Murphy as the corrupt High Court Judge Faden; Charles Edwards as a Wayne Enterprises executive; Tim Booth as Victor Zsasz; Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija as a homeless man, who is the last person to meet Bruce when he leaves Gotham City, and the first civilian to see Batman, Riste\u00e1rd Cooper and Andrew Pleavin as uniformed policemen, Jo Martin as a police prison official, and Shane Rimmer and Jeremy Theobald (the star and co-producer of Nolan's 1998 film Following) as Gotham Water Board technicians. Jack Gleeson, who had previously co-starred with Bale in 2002's Reign of Fire and later found fame for his role as Joffrey Baratheon in the HBO series Game of Thrones, appears as a young admirer of Batman who is later saved by him from Ra's al Ghul's men; Gleeson was cast at Bale's recommendation. Actors John Foo, Joey Ansah, Spencer Wilding, Dave Legeno, Khan Bonfils, Mark Strange, Grant Guirey, Rodney Ryan and Dean Alexandrou portray members of the League of Shadows. Hayden Nickel made his acting debut portraying James Gordon Jr.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn January 2003, Warner Bros. hired Memento director Christopher Nolan to direct an untitled Batman film, and David S. Goyer signed on to write the script two months later. Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by \"doing the origins story of the character, which is a story that's never been told before\". Nolan said that humanity and realism would be the basis of the origin film, and that \"the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [It] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises.\" Goyer said that the goal of the film was to get the audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner's 1978 film Superman, in its focus on depicting the character's growth. Also similar to Superman, Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for Batman Begins to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story.\nGoyer wanted to reboot the franchise; he and Nolan saw Batman as a romantic character, and Nolan envisioned a large, sweeping film like Lawrence of Arabia. Although Warner Bros. required the film not be R-rated, Nolan did not have a problem with this, as he wanted to make the film that he wanted to see when he was 11 years old. His personal \"jumping off point\" of inspiration was \"The Man Who Falls\", a short story by Denny O'Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in Batman Begins of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from \"The Man Who Falls\". Batman: The Long Halloween, written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale, influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay, with the villain Carmine Falcone as one of many elements which were drawn from Halloween's \"sober, serious approach\". The writers considered having Harvey Dent in the film, but replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they realized they \"couldn't do him justice\". The character was later portrayed by Aaron Eckhart in the 2008 sequel The Dark Knight. The sequel to Halloween, Batman: Dark Victory, also served as a minor influence. Goyer used the vacancy of Bruce Wayne's multi-year absence presented in Batman: Year One to help set up some of the film's events in the transpiring years. In addition, the film's Sergeant James \"Jim\" Gordon was based on his comic book incarnation as seen in Year One. The writers of Batman Begins also used Frank Miller's Year One plot device, which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and Gotham City's need for Batman. Due to Batman's extensive rogues gallery over seventy years, Goyer and Nolan decided to use the Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul as the film's villains, as both characters had not been featured in previous Batman films nor in Adam West's 1960s television series.\nA common idea in the comics is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan explained that by ignoring that idea \u2013 which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances \u2013 it emphasized the importance of bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nAs with all his films, Nolan refused a second unit; he did this in order to keep his vision consistent. Filming began in March 2004 in the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland (standing in for Bhutan). The crew built a village and the front doors to Ra's' temple, as well as a road to access the remote area. The weather was problematic, with 75 miles per hour (120 km/h) winds, rain, and a lack of snow. A shot that cinematographer Wally Pfister had planned to take using a crane had to be completed with a handheld camera.\nUnlike Burton and Schumacher's Gotham City that did not exist in the real world, Nolan shot exteriors in London, New York, and Chicago as he wanted the city to seem recognizable. In seeking inspiration from Superman and other blockbuster films of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Nolan based most of the production in England, specifically Shepperton Studios. A Batcave set was built there and measured 250 feet (76 m) long, 120 feet (37 m) wide, and 40 feet (12 m) high. Production designer Nathan Crowley installed twelve pumps to create a waterfall with 12,000 imperial gallons (55,000 L; 14,000 US gal), and built rocks using molds of real caves. An airship hangar at Cardington, Bedfordshire was rented by Warner Bros. during April 2004 and, converted into a 900 feet (270 m) sound stage, was where the slum-district of \"the Narrows\" and the feet of the monorails were filmed.\nMentmore Towers was chosen from twenty different locations for Wayne Manor, as Nolan and Crowley liked its white floors, which gave the impression of the manor as a memorial to Wayne's parents. The building chosen to represent Arkham Asylum was the National Institute for Medical Research building in Mill Hill, northwest London, England. The St Pancras railway station and the Abbey Mills Pumping Stations were used for Arkham's interiors. The Senate House of University College London was used for courtrooms. Some scenes, including the Tumbler pursuit, were filmed in Chicago at locations such as Lower Wacker Drive and 35 East Wacker. Authorities agreed to raise Franklin Street Bridge for a scene where access to the Narrows is closed.\nDespite the film's darkness, Nolan wanted to make the film appeal to a wide age range. \"Not the youngest kids obviously, I think what we've done is probably a bit intense for them but I certainly didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I would have loved to have seen a movie like this.\" Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nThe score for Batman Begins was composed by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. Nolan originally invited Zimmer to compose the music, and Zimmer asked Nolan if he could invite Howard to compose as well, as they had always planned a collaboration. The two composers collaborated on separate themes for the \"split personality\" of Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, Batman. Zimmer and Howard began composing in Los Angeles and moved to London where they stayed for twelve weeks to complete most of their writing. Zimmer and Howard sought inspiration for shaping the score by visiting the Batman Begins sets.\nZimmer wanted to avoid writing music that had been done in earlier Batman films, so the score became an amalgamation of orchestra and electronic music. The film's ninety-piece orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of the film's scenes where tragic memories of Bruce Wayne's parents are involved. \"He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it's like froze, arrested development,\" said Zimmer. He also attempted to add a human dimension to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as \"psychotic\", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film, with Zimmer composing the action sequences and Howard focusing on the dramatic scenes.\n\n\n== Special effects and design ==\n\n\n=== Design ===\nNolan used the 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner as a source of inspiration for Batman Begins. He screened Blade Runner to Pfister and two others to show the attitude and style that he wanted to draw from the film. Nolan described the film's world as \"an interesting lesson on the technique of exploring and describing a credible universe that doesn't appear to have any boundaries\", a lesson that he applied to the production of Batman Begins.\nNolan worked with production designer Nathan Crowley to create the look of Gotham City. Crowley built a model of the city that filled Nolan's garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that would reflect the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.\n\n\n=== Tumbler ===\n\nCrowley started the process of designing the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model to serve as the chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.\nThe styrofoam model was used to create a steel \"test frame\", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) in 5 seconds, possess a steering system to make sharp turns at city corners, and withstand a self-propelled launch of up to 30 feet (9.1 m). On the first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed Tumbler included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear axle, front tires by Hoosier (which are actually dirt racing tires used on the right rear of open wheel sprint cars), 4 rear 44/18.5-16.5 Interco Super Swamper TSL tires (44\" tall, 18.5\" wide, mounted on a 16.5\" wheel) and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.\nWith the design process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle possessing 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove on the streets of Chicago for the film's scenes.\nThe interior of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the interior of a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was oversized to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.\n\n\n=== Batsuit ===\n\nThe filmmakers intended to create a very mobile Batsuit that would allow the wearer to move easily to fight and crouch. Previous film incarnations of the Batsuit had been stiff and especially restrictive of full head movement. Costume designer Lindy Hemming and her crew worked on the Batsuit at an FX workshop codenamed \"Cape Town\", a secured compound located at Shepperton Studios in London. The Batsuit's basic design was a neoprene undersuit, which was shaped by attaching molded cream latex sections. Christian Bale was molded and sculpted prior to his physical training so the team could work on a full body cast. To avoid imperfections picked up by sculpting with clay, plastiline was used to smooth the surface. In addition, the team brewed different mixtures of foam to find the mixture that would be the most flexible, light, durable, and black. The latter presented a problem, since the process to make the foam black reduced the foam's durability.\nFor the cape, director Christopher Nolan wanted to have a \"flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels\". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had electrostatic flocking, a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show \"a man who has angst\", so his character would be revealed through the mask.\n\n\n=== Fight choreography ===\nFight choreographers for Batman Begins, Justo Dieguez and Andy Norman, trained actors and stunt performers using the Spanish Keysi Fighting Method, which itself gained fame after it was used in the film and its sequel, The Dark Knight; however, the method was modified in The Dark Knight Rises due to Batman's age and physical condition and in order to match Bale's fighting style. The method is a self-defense system whose training is based on the study and cultivation of natural instincts.\n\n\n=== Visual effects ===\nFor Batman Begins, Nolan preferred traditional stuntwork over computer-generated imagery. Scale models were used to represent the Narrows and Ra's al Ghul's temple. There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images, such as Gotham's skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, and some of the exterior monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI. The bats depicted in the film were entirely digital (except in shots containing only one or two bats), as it was decided that directing large numbers of real bats on-set would be problematic; dead bats were scanned to create digital models. Locations and sets were recreated digitally so that the flying bats would not appear incongruous once incorporated into the finished film.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Context ===\n\n2005 was expected by industry experts to underperform compared to 2004. Many attributed the slump to be a result of high ticket prices, marketing costs, DVD sales hitting record levels, and new technologies creating an incipient demand for movies delivered directly via the Internet, over-the-airwaves, satellite dish or cable set-top box. By the start of the theatrical summer in 2005 (May), the box office slumped for 11 consecutive weeks, with year-to-date ticket sales down 5.4 percent from last year even as ticket prices rose a moderate 3 percent, to around $6.40 on average, according to Exhibitor Relations. Theater attendance prior to the summer of 2005 declined about 8 percent.\nSeveral films were projected to not only perform well at the box office, but also reverse the slump at the box office. Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith was expected by the industry to be the top-grossing film of the summer due to being the final live action Star Wars film at the time. Other films that were expected to do well were Batman Begins, Madagascar, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Fantastic Four, War of the Worlds, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nBatman Begins was expected by industry experts to help reverse the box office slump in June. However, there were concerns over a possible soft opening for the film. The previous film, Batman & Robin, was widely panned by critics and was credited with stalling the franchise since 1997. Bale's lack of star power at the time and a lack of iconic villains such as the Joker and Penguin that were portrayed by A-list celebrities were seen as possible detachments from audiences. Some also expressed concerns that Holmes' involvement with the film could derail the film's financial prospect due to her high-profile relationship with Tom Cruise (whose film War of the Worlds opened the following weekend) after his controversial appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nWarner Bros. held the world premiere for Batman Begins in Tokyo, Japan on May 31, 2005. The film opened on June 15, 2005, in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters, including 55 IMAX theaters.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe DVD of Batman Begins was released on October 18, 2005, in both single-disc and two-disc deluxe editions and also released on VHS and UMD Video formats. In addition to the film, the deluxe edition contained featurettes and other bonus materials. The edition contained a small paperback booklet, the first Batman story, featured in Detective Comics #27, as well as Batman: The Man Who Falls and an excerpt from Batman: The Long Halloween. Batman Begins achieved first place in national sales and rental charts in October 2005, becoming the top-selling DVD of the fourth quarter of 2005. The DVD grossed $11.36 million in rental revenue. The DVD held its position at the top of the sales chart for a second week, but fell to second place behind Bewitched on video rental charts. The film had brought in $167 million in DVD sales by August 2006.\nBatman Begins was released on HD DVD on October 10, 2006. A Limited Edition Giftset of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 8, 2008, to coincide with The Dark Knight which hit theaters July 18, 2008. Due to the successful box office performance of The Dark Knight, the Batman Begins DVD saw an increase in both sales and rentals. Batman Begins was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on December 19, 2017. It received a novelization written by Dennis O'Neil, and a comic book adaptation by Scott Beatty.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nBatman Begins ranked at the top in its opening weekend, accumulating $48 million, which was seen as \"strong but unimpressive by today's instantaneous blockbuster standards\". The film's five-day gross was $72.9 million, beating Batman Forever (1995) as the franchise high. Batman Begins also broke the five-day opening record in the 55 IMAX theaters, grossing $3.16 million. Polled moviegoers rated the film with an A, and according to the studio's surveys, Batman Begins was considered the best of all the Batman films. The audience's demographic was 57 percent male and 54 percent people over the age of 25.\nThe film held its top spot for another weekend, accumulating $28 million in a 43 percent drop from its first weekend. Batman Begins went on to gross $205 million in North America and had a worldwide total of $371.8 million from its original release. It earned $1.6 million more from its 2012 re-release, bringing its lifetime worldwide total to $373.4 million. It is the fourth-highest-grossing Batman film, as of August 2012, behind Tim Burton's Batman, which grossed $411 million worldwide and also being surpassed by its sequels The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, both of which have grossed over $1 billion. Batman Begins averaged $12,634 per theater in its opening weekend. It was released in more theaters, but sold fewer tickets than the other previous Batman movies, with the exception of Batman & Robin. Batman Begins was the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2005 in the United States.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives Batman Begins an approval rating of 85% based on 293 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating reviews, the film received an average score of 70 out of 100, based on 41 critics, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJames Berardinelli applauded Nolan and Goyer's work in creating more understanding into \"who [Batman] is and what motivates him\", something Berardinelli felt Tim Burton's film had lacked; at the same time, Berardinelli felt the romantic aspect between Bale and Holmes did not work because the actors lacked the chemistry Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder (Superman), or Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man) shared in their respective roles. According to Total Film, Nolan manages to create such strong characters and story that the third-act action sequences cannot compare to \"the frisson of two people talking\", and Katie Holmes and Christian Bale's romantic subplot has a spark \"refreshingly free of Peter Parker/Mary Jane-style whining\".\nLos Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan, who felt the film began slowly, stated that the \"story, psychology and reality, not special effects\", assisted the darkness behind Batman's arsenal; he noted that Neeson and Holmes, unlike Bale's ability to \"feel his role in his bones\", do not appear to fit their respective characters in \"being both comic-book archetypes and real people\". The New Yorker's David Denby did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion. He was unimpressed with the film, when comparing it to the two Tim Burton films, and that Christian Bale's presence was hindered by the \"dull earnestness of the screenplay\", the final climax was \"cheesy and unexciting\", and that Nolan had resorted to imitating the \"fakery\" used by other filmmakers when filming action sequences.\n\nMichael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune believed Nolan and Goyer managed to \"comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions,\" and that Nolan takes the series out of the \"slam-bang Hollywood jokefests\" the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he \"felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating\", citing this film as the best of the live-action Batman films. In contrast, J. R. Jones, from the Chicago Reader, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the \"hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche\". Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was \"the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not realize I was waiting for\". Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal \u2013 the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal \u2013 as well as the focus on \"the story and character\" with less stress on \"high-tech action\".\nLike Berardinelli, USA Today's Mike Clark thought Bale performed the role of Batman as well as he did Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was \"frustratingly underdeveloped\". Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited \"both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in American Psycho\", and that the film works so well because of the realism, stating, \"Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; Serpico New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one.\" In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of \"one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all\"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton who she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in \"emotional complexity\" where the rest of the movie failed.\nFilm director Tim Burton\u2014who had directed the 1989 Batman film and its first sequel\u2014felt Nolan \"captured the real spirit that these kind of movies are supposed to have nowadays. When I did Batman twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies. You couldn't go into that dark side of comics yet. The last couple of years that has become acceptable and Nolan certainly got more to the root of what the Batman comics are about.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Impact ==\nBatman Begins has been cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s. On the film's 10th anniversary, Forbes published an article describing its lasting influence: \"Reboot became part of our modern vocabulary, and superhero origin stories became increasingly en vogue for the genre. The phrase \"dark and gritty\" likewise joined the cinematic lexicon, influencing our perception of different approaches to storytelling not only in the comic book film genre but in all sorts of other genres as well.\" Shawn Adler of MTV stated Batman Begins heralded a trend of darker genre films, that either retold back-stories or rebooted them altogether. Examples he cited were Casino Royale, as well as the in-development RoboCop, Red Sonja, and Grayskull. In 2012, Kevin Feige, film producer and president of Marvel Studios, stated, \"Chris Nolan's Batman is the greatest thing that happened [to superhero films] because it bolstered everything.\" Filmmakers, screenwriters and producers who have mentioned Batman Begins or The Dark Knight Trilogy to describe their projects include:\n\n\n== Themes ==\nComic book writer and author Danny Fingeroth argues that a strong theme in the film is Bruce's search for a father figure, saying \"[Alfred] is the good father that Bruce comes to depend on. Bruce's real father died before they could establish an adult relationship, and Liam Neeson's Ducard is stern and demanding, didactic and challenging, but not a father figure with any sympathy. If Bruce is anyone's son, he is Alfred's. [Morgan] Freeman's Lucius is cool and imperturbable, another steady anchor in Bruce's life.\" Blogger Mark Fisher states that Bruce's search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure, with Thomas Wayne and Ra's al Ghul being the two counterpoints. Alfred provides a maternal figure of unconditional love, despite the overall lack of focus on a mother figure in Bruce's life.\nFingeroth also argues that a major theme in the film is fear, which supports the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was \"a person who would confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it\". Fingeroth referred to this film's depiction as \"the man with fear\u2014but who rises above it\". The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow. The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce's conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.\nCritic Brian Orndorf considered Batman Begins \"fierce\" and \"demonstrative in brood\", giving the film an abundance of gravitas and energy. It strays away from the lighter fare of Joel Schumacher's 1997 Batman film, Batman & Robin, which contained camp one-liners throughout. The theme of fear is intensified with the help of the musical score by Zimmer and Howard, which also \"eschews traditional heroic themes\". Also contrary to previous Batman films, a psychological investigation of Bruce Wayne's split personality in the bat suit is only lightly touched upon. Orndorf noted that Bruce is a \"character constantly striving to do the right thing, not worn down by incessant reexamination\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nVigilante film\nNeo-noir\nList of films shot in Iceland\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (Warner Bros.)\nOfficial website (DC Comics)\nBatman Begins at IMDb\nBatman Begins title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nBatman Begins at the TCM Movie Database\nBatman Begins at AllMovie\nBatman Begins at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nBatman Begins Production Notes, page 1 and pages 2\u20136.

            "Blackhawk is a 1952 American  15-chapter science fiction adventure movie serial from Columbia Pictures, based on the comic book Blackhawk, first published by Quality Comics, but later owned by competitor DC Comics. It was Columbia's forty-ninth serial. The one-sheet poster referred to the serial as The Miraculous Blackhawk: Freedom's Champion. The home video release added the tagline: \"Fearless Champion of Freedom\". The actual on-screen title is Blackhawk: Fearless Champion of Freedom.\nBlackhawk stars Kirk Alyn as Blackhawk and Carol Forman as the foreign spy that must be stopped from stealing the experimental super-fuel \"Element-X\"; Alyn and Forman were also the hero and villain of Columbia's earlier Superman.\nBlackhawk was produced by the famously cheap Sam Katzman and directed by the team of Spencer Gordon Bennet and Fred F. Sears. It is considered cheap and lackluster, made in the waning years of studio movie serial production.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nA flying squadron of World War II veterans, The International Brotherhood, is a private flying investigative force led by Blackhawk. They uncover a gang of underworld henchmen, led by the notorious foreign spy Laska, who reports to The Leader, a mystery man. During the serial, Blackhawk and his flying squadron set about bringing these criminals to justice, following a series of cliff-hanger adventures.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nKirk Alyn as Blackhawk\nMichael Fox as Mr. Case\nDon C. Harvey as Olaf (as Don Harvey)\nRick Vallin as Stan/Boris\nJohn Crawford as Chuck\nFrank Ellis as Hendrickson [Chs. 1-2,4,8-9]\nLarry Stewart as Andre\nWeaver Levy as Chop-Chop\nCarol Forman as Laska\nZon Murray as Bork\nNick Stuart as Cress\nMarshall Reed as Aller\nPierce Lyden as Dyke\nWilliam Fawcett as Dr. Rolph [Chs.4-7]\nRory Mallinson as Hodge [Chs. 11-14]\n\n\n== Chapter titles ==\nDistress Call from Space\nBlackhawk Traps a Traitor\nIn the Enemy's Hideout\nThe Iron Monster\nHuman Targets\nBlackhawk's Leap for Life\nMystery Fuel\nBlasted from the Sky\nBlackhawk Tempts Fate\nChase for Element X\nForced Down\nDrums of Doom\nBlackhawk's Daring Plan\nBlackhawk's Wild Ride\nThe Leader Unmasked\n\n\n== Production ==\nWriter George Plympton described a production staff meeting where they listened to a recording of the short-lived Blackhawk radio series. Everyone at the meeting was terrified at the confusing babble of accents. For Columbia's serial, all recruits of the Blackhawk squadron speak with standard American accents.\n\n\n=== Stunts ===\nIn chapter 3 Kirk Alyn performs a potentially dangerous stunt without the use of a stunt double. In order to save the life of squadron member Stan, who's tied to a stake in the path of a taxiing plane, Blackhawk (Alyn) runs up to the vehicle and turns it aside by grabbing the wing. A hidden pilot inside the plane steered it to simulate the movement. When writing this scene, the screenwriters were thinking of a small lighter wood-and-canvas plane, not the heavy metal aircraft used in the final scene; it could have easily killed Alyn if the stunt's timing had gone wrong.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThe serial was released on VHS in 1997 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. In 2016, it was released on DVD by Mill Creek Entertainment under license from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWilliam C. Cline describes the serial as a \"pretty good airplane adventure\" in his book In the Nick of Time. Despite this, Blackhawk was the last aviation serial; aviation had rapidly become less impressive in American popular culture, and science fiction was taking its place.\nMade during the 1950s, Blackhawk was produced after the movie serial's heyday; many from this period were generally inferior to those made in the previous decade.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlackhawk at IMDb\nBlackhawk at AllMovie",
            "Blue Beetle is a 2023 American superhero film based on the DC Comics character Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle. Directed by \u00c1ngel Manuel Soto and written by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, it is the 14th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). Xolo Maridue\u00f1a stars as Reyes, a recent college graduate who is bestowed with an armor that grants him superpowers after being accidentally chosen by an ancient alien relic known as the Scarab. Adriana Barraza, Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar, Raoul Max Trujillo, Susan Sarandon, and George Lopez also star in the film.\nDevelopment of a film featuring Reyes began by the end of November 2018 with Dunnet-Alcocer attached as screenwriter. Soto was hired to direct the film in February 2021 for the streaming service HBO Max. Maridue\u00f1a was cast that August, and the film was changed to have a theatrical release in December. Further casting took place in early 2022, and filming lasted from late May to mid-July at Wilder Studios in Decatur, Georgia, as well as in El Paso, Texas, and Puerto Rico. It is the first live-action superhero film with a Latino lead.\nBlue Beetle premiered in El Paso on August 14, 2023, and was released in the United States on August 18. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and became the most streamed film on Warner Bros.' service Max, the successor to HBO Max, in the United States. It underperformed at the box office, grossing $131 million worldwide against a production budget of $104\u2013125 million, which made it the lowest-grossing film in the DCEU. Its box office performance was attributed to factors such as the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, the franchise's imminent reboot with the DC Universe (DCU), and Hurricane Hilary. An animated follow-up series is in development.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Antarctica, members of Kord Industries, led by its co-founder and CEO Victoria Kord, locate an ancient alien artifact known as the Scarab. Meanwhile, Jaime Reyes returns to his hometown of Palmera City after graduating from Gotham Law University, only to learn that his family is facing eviction from their home due to financial difficulties. Jaime's sister Milagro manages to get him a job at Victoria's mansion. However, both are fired after Jaime stops a confrontation between Victoria and her niece Jenny. Jenny later tells Jaime to meet her at Kord Tower the next day to discuss a \"job opportunity\".\nThe next day, Jenny finds that Victoria is using the Scarab for her One Man Army Corps (OMAC) projects. She steals the Scarab and avoids security by giving it to Jaime, hidden inside a Big Belly Burger to-go box. At home, Jaime's family convinces him to open the box, and when Jaime ends up holding the Scarab, it activates and fuses with him, encasing him in an armored exoskeleton that launches him from the stratosphere to all over the city. Jaime tracks down Jenny for answers, rescuing her from Victoria's armed forces. She tells Jaime the Scarab is a sentient weapon and it has chosen Jaime to be its host. With the help of Jaime's uncle Rudy, Jaime and Jenny break into Kord Tower to retrieve a smartwatch that once belonged to Jenny's father Ted, but are attacked by Victoria's bodyguard Ignacio Carapax, who has an OMAC prototype infused in his body. The Scarab, revealed to be named Khaji-Da, temporarily takes over Jaime's body and battles Carapax, but Jaime refuses to let it kill Carapax. Rudy and Jenny help incapacitate Carapax, then escape to Jenny's childhood home with Jaime.\nJenny uses Ted's watch to activate his secret laboratory and reveals that Ted was originally a vigilante named Blue Beetle who spent his life studying Khaji-Da before mysteriously disappearing, leaving his company in Victoria's hands. When they notice Victoria's helicopter flying toward Jaime's home, Jaime summons Khaji-Da and returns to protect his family, but Jaime's father Alberto collapses and dies from a heart attack, distracting Jaime and allowing Carapax to capture him. Jaime is taken to an island fortress near Cuba, where he is strapped to a machine that downloads information from Khaji-Da into the OMACs. While unconscious, Jaime experiences a vision from Alberto in the afterlife, who encourages him to embrace his destiny as the new Blue Beetle.\nWhile Jenny and the Reyes family use Ted's Bugship and its weapons arsenal to storm the island, Jaime awakens and escapes as Carapax's OMAC suit evolves into a more powerful form. Jaime reunites with his family, then encounters Carapax and battles him. Jaime nearly kills Carapax before Khaji-Da stops him, showing Jaime memories of Carapax's from the information download revealing his enslavement by Victoria for the OMAC experiments, including the death of Carapax's mother at Victoria's hands, leading Jaime to spare him, and Carapax to subsequently turn on Victoria, setting his OMAC suit to explode and destroy the island, himself and Victoria as vengeance for his mother. As the Reyes family escapes the island, they take time to mourn Alberto.\nIn the aftermath, Jenny becomes the new CEO of Kord Industries and promises to repair the damage caused to the Reyes family, by helping them rebuild their home. As the neighbors gather around the remains of the Reyes family's home and provide support, Jaime kisses Jenny and then offers to fly her to the Kord Estate. In a mid-credits scene, a distorted recording is broadcast in Ted's laboratory, attempting to inform Jenny that he is alive.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nXolo Maridue\u00f1a as Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle:A recent college graduate who gains superpowers when an alien Scarab grafts onto him, forming a powerful reconfiguring exoskeleton around his body.\nAdriana Barraza as Nana: Jaime's grandmother, who it turns out is a retired revolutionary.\nDami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar as Alberto Reyes: Jaime's father.\nElpidia Carrillo as Rocio Reyes: Jaime's mother.\nBruna Marquezine as Jenny Kord: The daughter of Ted Kord and Jaime's love interest.

Sarandon says Victoria represents the theme of \"imperialism in the name of democracy\", and that she is driven by a need to be ambitious and prove herself, after her brother mysteriously disappears and leaves his company behind.\nGeorge Lopez as Rudy Reyes: Jaime's uncle.\nBelissa Escobedo as Milagro Reyes: Jaime's younger sister\nHarvey Guill\u00e9n as Dr. Jose Francisco Morales Rivera de la Cruz / \"Dr. Sanchez\": A scientist who works for Victoria.\nAdditionally, Becky G provides the voice of Khaji-Da, a sentient entity that imbues and controls the Scarab, while Bobby McGruther has a voice-only cameo as Ted Kord, a previous Blue Beetle, in the mid-credits scene.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures and DC Films were developing a film based on Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle by the end of November 2018, with Mexican-born Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer writing the screenplay. Zev Foreman was executive producing the project for Warner Bros., which was set to be the first DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film as well as the first live-action superhero film starring a Latino lead. By December 2020, DC Films was planning to release several mid-budget films a year exclusively on the streaming service HBO Max, rather than in theaters, as part of new DC Films president Walter Hamada's plan for the DCEU, with Blue Beetle listed as one such project in 2021. Puerto Rican director \u00c1ngel Manuel Soto was hired to direct the film in February 2021. During a call received from Warner Bros., Soto had pitched various ideas, including a film about Bane's origin story, but Warner Bros. had intended for him to direct a film based on Reyes' Blue Beetle. In April, Blue Beetle was included on DC's slate of films that were expected to be released in 2022 or 2023.\nJohn Rickard, the president of production at the Safran Company, was producing the film for HBO Max by that August, when filming was expected to begin in early 2022. In December 2021, Warner Bros. revealed that the film would be receiving a theatrical release in August 2023 instead of being produced directly for HBO Max; Though the film was originally intended to be released as an HBO Max exclusive, the studio decided to release it theatrically after they enjoyed Soto's creative vision. In mid-April 2022, Soto and cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski visited El Paso, Texas, to meet with local artists, muralists, musicians, and historians to understand the feel of the city. Peter Safran was revealed as a producer that October, and worked on the film until he became the co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios alongside James Gunn the next month; Rickard and Foreman were ultimately credited as the producers.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nIn October 2021, Soto said Dunnet-Alcocer's script featured \"the Latino family at its core\", while star Xolo Maridue\u00f1a said in August 2022 that the family aspect of the film and character were \"inherent to the comics\" and felt had not been explored as much with other superhero films. Soto did not want the film to be \"another story where 15 minutes in, something happens, and 50 minutes later, he's dominating the experience, and by the end, he's saving the world\" and instead wanted to explore his growth, saying that \"He's [Reyes] not going to save the world yet; he doesn't deserve to yet\". Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer had decided to do so by taking a grounded approach towards his character while exploring his relationship with his family and Khaji-Da, the symbiotic alien that provides Reyes's powers. Soto also took inspiration from DC's The New 52 comics, and the Mission: Impossible and Indiana Jones franchises.\nThe film also features Reyes's family witnessing his first transformation into Blue Beetle. The intention was twofold, as Soto had amusingly felt Latino families were \"very nosy\" while also showing that \"family is our superpower to some extent\". He also described Reyes' transformation as being similar to the works of David Cronenberg but for kids and wanted the film to be fun. He also focused on the pronunciation of names in the film, and included a scene in which Victoria Kord called an employee Sanchez despite it not being his name. The decision to include the scene was to show that \"Latinos are not a monolith\", with Soto further adding that the audience would feel the warmth of Reyes' family and become familiarized with them after the first act. Fellow star Susan Sarandon revealed the following month that the film would have several scenes spoken in Spanish, with subtitles being provided. Soto affirmed this, saying the film would feature \"Spanglish\", saying Spanish will be used for scenes that feature elder characters and also when characters \"speak from the heart\". The final writing credits were given to Dunnet-Alcocer, with off-screen additional literary credit given to Gary Dauberman. Soto had also stated that the film would explore Victoria Kord's relationship with her brother Ted Kord. He had also stated that the presence of Ted's daughter, his gadgets, and the idea of Ted and Dan Garrett would also impact the film's story, although it would be contextualized through Reyes's perspective.\nThe film is set in the fictional Palmera City, which was an original creation for the film, rather than El Paso, Texas as is featured in the comics. Soto said this was to create a world specific to Jaime Reyes on a similar level to Metropolis for Superman and Gotham City for Batman, and to help position the character as \"a potential leader\" in the new DC-based franchise the DC Universe (DCU), while stating that Gunn and Safran felt that the film could be included anywhere in the DCU timeline. Soto had explained that the creative team had created the city as a \"metropolitan of Latinos\", and that the city was divided into two parts: Reyes's neighborhood and the affluent financial district. He had also identified Reyes's upbringing as being more humble, as his family had come from the working class, had been struggling, and was also a part of \"marginalized communities under the threat of gentrification\". Inspiration for the film came from the video game Injustice 2 (2017) and the comic book storyline \"Infinite Crisis\" (2005\u20132006), in which Jaime Reyes debuted, along with the comics in The New 52 for the design of the suit, while the comic book miniseries Blue Beetle: Graduation Day (2022\u20132023) incorporated elements from the film, such as Palmera City and Victoria Kord.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nXolo Maridue\u00f1a was Soto's first choice to portray Reyes, with Soto explaining that he \"couldn't stop seeing [Maridue\u00f1a] as the character\" since he was hired to direct the film, enjoying his performance in Cobra Kai. He also noted that his experience with martial arts while filming Cobra Kai would help with his role as Blue Beetle. Soto and Warner Bros. offered the role to Maridue\u00f1a on August 1, 2021, he was publicly revealed to be in talks for the film the next day, and his casting was officially confirmed later that day at the premiere for the DCEU film The Suicide Squad (2021). When learning of the role, Maridue\u00f1a was most excited that Reyes is a Latino character and he could bring Latino representation to a superhero project.\nIn early March 2022, Bruna Marquezine was cast as Reyes's love interest, Jenny Kord, with Belissa Escobedo playing Reyes's sister Milagros, and Harvey Guill\u00e9n cast as Dr. Delacruz. Later that month, the rest of Reyes's family was cast: George Lopez as uncle Rudy, Adriana Barraza as Nana, Elpidia Carrillo as Rocio, and Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar as Alberto. Soto said he wanted to create an authentic Mexican family with real accents and experiences, and also wanted the elder members of the family to be portrayed by \"beloved\" Mexican actors from Latin American cinema who had also crossed over to United States cinema and paved the way for members of the younger generation, such as Maridue\u00f1a and Escobedo. By the end of the same month, Sharon Stone was in talks to play the villain Victoria Kord, an original creation for the film which was believed to be the wife of Ted Kord, the second Blue Beetle in the comics. Raoul Trujillo also joined the cast then as Carapax the Indestructible Man. In mid-April 2022, Susan Sarandon was cast as Victoria Kord after negotiations with Stone ended. In June 2023, Becky G announced that she would be providing the voice of Khaji-Da for the film.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nBlue Beetle's suit was designed by Mayes C. Rubeo and the team from Nine B Collective. The design team was inspired by artist Cully Hamner's original design of the comic book character and from his appearance in Infinite Crisis #3, the Injustice games, Young Justice, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They had difficulty in creating the mask to fit Maridue\u00f1a's full face but also allow him to be emotive, particularly for the mouth area. As such, the team had decided to merge the designs of organic alien technology and insectoid features within his suit. Visual inspiration for Palmera City came from Akira (1988), Neo Tokyo (1987), and Miami. Soto decided to insert a Nintendo Power Glove for Blue Beetle following the inclusion of a shield in the script.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began by May 25, 2022, taking place in the Atlanta metropolitan area, primarily at Wilder Studios in Decatur, Georgia, using the working title Mofongo. Pawel Pogorzelski served as the cinematographer. Scenes for the film's third act took place at the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a 500-year-old Spanish fortress located in the Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Filming also occurred in El Paso. Sarandon completed filming her scenes by the end of June, and Trujillo said in early July that filming was almost complete. Filming wrapped on July 18 in Puerto Rico. Two days of additional photography took place in February 2023. The film was primarily shot on location with a heavy use of practical effects, such as for the Blue Beetle suit. Soto felt that the use of real-life locations allowed for the practical effects to be better integrated into the film. He said he wanted to prevent the film from relying too heavily on visual effects, which he described as \"a tool, not a dependency\", to avoid overworking the visual effects artists.\n\n\n=== Editing and visual effects ===\nCraig Alpert edited the film while Kelvin McIlwain served as the visual effects supervisor, after previously working on the DCEU films Aquaman (2018) and The Suicide Squad (2021). Visual effects were provided by Digital Domain, Rise FX, Rodeo FX, and Industrial Light & Magic. The film features a stop-motion sequence featuring the eponymous character from the Mexican television series El Chapulin Colorado (1973\u20131979), recreating the 1979 intro of the series; the sequence was animated at Ach\u00f3 Studios, with Quique Rivera serving as animation director on the sequence. The sequence was conceived by Soto and Dunnet-Alcocer, both of whom grew up watching the series and wanted to include an homage to it.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nBobby Krlic was confirmed to score the film by the trailer's release in April 2023. A soundtrack album featuring his score was released by WaterTower Music on August 18, 2023; a track from the soundtrack album, \"Blue Beetle Suite\", was released as a single on August 11.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nSoto, Dunnet-Alcocer, and Maridue\u00f1a promoted the film at the virtual DC FanDome event in October 2021, where they discussed their preparation for filming and revealed concept art for the film. The first trailer for the film was released on April 3, 2023, revealing that the film takes place in Palmera City, an original location created for the film. It also showed a first look at the costumes of Dan Garrett and Ted Kord, the previous Blue Beetles before Jaime. The Verge's Ash Parrish thought that the trailer looked \"fun\" and stated: \"I didn't immediately roll my eyes at yet another superhero flick, so that might be a good sign DC has something decent on its hands.\" Devan Coggan from Entertainment Weekly thought Lopez comparing Jaime's situation to Batman was an amusing moment, while noting the trailer had posited Jaime's character as being \"an aimless college grad, who's close with his family but a bit directionless\".\n\nA second trailer was released on July 11, 2023, through Entertainment Tonight. Andy Behbakht, writing for Screen Rant, felt the trailer contained more action scenes than the first and focused on Jaime's relationship with the Scarab. For Empire, James White opined that the trailer's tone was a \"blend\" of other films such as Iron Man (2008), Spider-Man (2002), and Spy Kids (2001) and remarked that the trailer \"promises action over angst\". Griff Griffin from Men's Journal felt the CGI in the trailer was better, and described the suit as being an \"insectoid version of Iron Man's nanotech\" from Avengers: Infinity War (2018). However, Kat Bailey from IGN felt that while the trailer offered a \"more straightforward look at Reyes' powers\" and fan reception was positive, fans were also worried about the film's success due to the critical and commercial failure of DC's previous 2023 films.\nToyota entered a 360-degree marketing campaign with Warner Bros. to cross-promote the film and the 2024 Toyota Tacoma model pickup truck across digital and social media platforms, television programs, and in-theater advertising spots. The 2024 Tacoma model was featured in the film along with a 2018 model named \"Taco\" as the personal vehicle of Uncle Rudy. Toyota Motor North America's group vice president of marketing Lisa Materazzo said the film appealed to the company due to its high anticipation and to showcase the heritage of the Tacoma truck, which she said were aligned with the characters in the film and what they wanted to emphasize with the Tacoma.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nBlue Beetle premiered in El Paso, Texas on August 14, 2023, in partnership with the El Paso Times, and had its red carpet premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre on August 15. Due to the then-ongoing 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, the cast of the film did not attend the premiere, with Soto praising them as \"heroes\". Blue Beetle was theatrically released in the United States on August 18.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nBlue Beetle was released on digital download on September 26, 2023, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 31, by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. The film became available for streaming on Max, the successor to HBO Max, on November 17, 2023, where it debuted as the most streamed film on the platform in the United States.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nBlue Beetle grossed $72.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.8 million. It is the lowest-grossing film in the DCEU, behind Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023), and underperformed at the box office.\nIn the United States and Canada, Blue Beetle was released alongside Strays, and was projected to gross $25\u201332 million from 3,871 theaters in its opening weekend. The film earned $10 million on its first day, including $3.3 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $25 million, topping the box office and becoming the first film to dethrone Barbie; 39% of the opening weekend audience was Hispanic, while 66% was male. The film's $43 million global opening was described by Variety as \"one of the softest starts in the history of the DC Cinematic Universe\", which was attributed to two concurrent strikes in Hollywood, and a tepid audience awaiting the arrival of Gunn and Safran's DCU slate. Warner Bros. cited the effects of Hurricane Hilary as a reason behind the poor domestic opening, given it affected Los Angeles which was one of the film's top markets. The film earned $12.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 51%), finishing third behind newcomer Gran Turismo and Barbie. National Cinema Day, a day where movie theaters offer discounted tickets for moviegoers, was credited for boosting the film's Sunday numbers in its second weekend. It earned $7.1 million in its third weekend (and a total of $9.4 million during the four-day Labor Day weekend), remaining in third place.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 77% of 277 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Led by Xolo Maridue\u00f1a's magnetic performance in the title role, Blue Beetle is a refreshingly family-focused superhero movie with plenty of humor and heart.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 from 52 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported that moviegoers gave the film a 82% positive score, with 65% saying they would definitely recommend it.\nMark Kermode of The Guardian gave the film 4/5 stars, writing, \"Blue Beetle may be frontloaded with visual fireworks that neatly meld the practical and the virtual, but it is the likable interplay between its down-to-earth characters that gives the film oomph, making it more than just a Shazam-style romp.\" Odie Henderson of The Boston Globe gave the film 3/4 stars, calling it \"a watchable time-waster made better by the actors and the cinematography by Pawel Pogorzelski.\" The A.V. Club's Justin Lowe gave it a B\u2212 grade, writing, \"the filmmakers and the SFX team have created a memorable visual style for the film, supported by a wide array of Latino talent that underpins the authenticity of the narrative and the visuals.\" The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey gave it 3/5 stars, calling it \"a likeable, if predictable, take on the superhero origin story that at no point invokes time travel, the multiverse, or a ginormous portal in the sky. And thank god for that.\"\nJake Wilson of The Age was more critical, writing, \"Director Angel Manuel Soto and writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer do their best to weave a few additional progressive elements into this basically routine production, evidently aimed at younger viewers.\" He gave the film 2.5/5 stars. Ed Potton of The Times gave it 2/5 stars and wrote, \"Blue Beetle is the latest product off the superhero production line and it's as tediously familiar as rail strikes and rainy Augusts. The only thing that differentiates this DC Comics adaptation from its scores of predecessors is the fact that its characters are mostly Latino-American.\" CNN Entertainment's Brian Lowry praised the casting and action sequences, but criticized the villain as \"lousy\". He concluded, \"Blue Beetle might be able to soar into the stratosphere, but that feels like a hurdle the movie just doesn't clear.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nAt the 51st Saturn Awards, Blue Beetle was nominated for Best Superhero Film and won for Best Younger Performer in a Film (Maridue\u00f1a). Blue Beetle was nominated for the Emerging Technology Award at the 22nd Visual Effects Society Awards for the development of \"Machine Learning Cloth\".\n\n\n== Future ==\n\n\n=== Continuation in the DC Universe ===\nIn January 2023, Gunn said the film was \"disconnected\" from previous DCEU entries and could connect to the DCU. By April, the Blue Beetle character was reportedly part of Gunn and Safran's plans for the DCU. In June, Gunn said Blue Beetle would be the first DCU character while noting Superman (2025) is the first DCU film, while Safran soon clarified that Maridue\u00f1a's Reyes would continue in the DCU but the film itself would stand on its own. Later that month, Soto said Blue Beetle was a part of the DCU and future plans for the franchise, but was not connected to all prior DCEU films, explaining the film \"lives in the world where superheroes exist. But that doesn't mean that a certain event, or certain alliance, or certain things from the past dictate where our film is going\". He also expressed interest in the film being the first part of a trilogy. In September, Gunn reiterated that Maridue\u00f1a would continue to play Reyes in the DCU, but clarified that any DC media released before the first projects for the DCU in 2024 would not be canon to that franchise.\n\n\n=== Animated series ===\nIn June 2024, DC Studios and Warner Bros. Animation were revealed to be developing an animated television series focused on Blue Beetle for the DCU. It was expected to build off the film but tell its own story, and had the potential to lead to Maridue\u00f1a starring in a DCU film if successful. Miguel Puga had been working on the series since early 2024 and was expected to serve as showrunner and director. Cristian Martinez was set as writer, with Soto, Dunnet-Alcocer, and Rickard all serving as executive producers. Galen Vaisman, an executive producer on the film, was overseeing the series for DC Studios. Contracts with the main cast were said to be \"in flux\" but DC Studios had received positive responses when asking the film's cast about returning to reprise their roles. Maridue\u00f1a confirmed in July that he would reprise his role as Blue Beetle in the series.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website  (Archived August 16, 2023, at the Wayback Machine)\nBlue Beetle at WarnerBros.com\nBlue Beetle at DC.com\nBlue Beetle at IMDb \nBlue Beetle at AllMovie \nBlue Beetle on Max",

            "Constantine ( KON-st\u0259n-TEEN) is a 2005 American superhero horror film directed by Francis Lawrence in his directorial debut. Written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello from a story by Brodbin, it is loosely based on the DC Comics/Vertigo Comics Hellblazer graphic novels. The film stars Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, a cynical exorcist with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true forms and to travel between Earth and Hell. Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Stormare also feature.\nConstantine was released theatrically in the United States on February 18, 2005, and grossed $230.9 million worldwide against a production budget between $70\u2013100 million. While it received mixed reviews from film critics, it has since garnered a cult following in the years following its release. In 2022, a sequel was announced and is currently in development.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Mexico, a scavenger in a ruined church recovers the tip of the spear that pierced Jesus Christ, and after becoming possessed, takes it to Los Angeles. There, cynical occult expert John Constantine exorcises a demon from a young girl after witnessing its attempt to come through her to Earth, something that should be impossible because of a treaty between Heaven and Hell. Suffering from terminal lung cancer, Constantine meets with the half-breed angel Gabriel to request an extension to his life in exchange for his work deporting Hell's forces. Gabriel responds that performing good deeds for selfish reasons will not secure his way into Heaven.\nElsewhere, detective Angela Dodson investigates the death of her twin sister Isabel who leaped from a psychiatric hospital roof. Angela refuses to believe her sister, a devout Catholic, would commit suicide and condemn herself to Hell. Watching security footage, Angela hears Isabel say \"Constantine\", and seeks out his assistance. He refuses to help until he witnesses demons pursuing Angela and fends them off. He uses a ritual to see Isabel in Hell and confirms she killed herself. Constantine tells Angela that he committed suicide as a teenager because he was traumatized by seeing supernatural creatures and, though he was revived, when he dies his suicide attempt has condemned him to Hell.\nAt the morgue, Constantine's friend Father Hennessy discovers a symbol on Isabel's wrist but is killed by the half-breed demon Balthazar. Constantine and Angela discover Hennessy carved the symbol into his hand for them to find. Angela also finds a clue hidden in Isabel's hospital room concerning a chapter of Hell's bible. Before being killed by Balthazar, Constantine's ally Beeman tells the pair the symbol represents the antichrist Mammon, Lucifer's son, and the chapter prophesies him usurping his father and conquering the Earth, using a powerful psychic and divine assistance; the psychic, Isabel, killed herself to stop Mammon. Angela reveals she possessed powers like Isabel's but repressed them to avoid being deemed insane like her sister. Constantine helps Angela reawaken her powers by inducing a near-death experience, and she uses them to find Balthazar.\nConstantine interrogates Balthazar and learns that the blood of Christ on the spear tip is Mammon's divine assistance, and Angela has been chosen as his new host. An unseen entity destroys Balthazar and abducts Angela who becomes possessed by Mammon. With the help of witch doctor Papa Midnite, Constantine induces visions to locate Angela at the psychiatric hospital. Alongside his driver and apprentice, Chas Kramer, Constantine arms himself and assaults the building, battling through hordes of demons to Angela. Constantine and Chas seemingly exorcise Mammon from her, but Chas is killed by the unseen force, revealed to be Gabriel. Resentful at God's favoritism for humanity and forgiveness for even the most wicked, Gabriel intends to unleash Hell on Earth so that those who survive will become truly worthy of His love. Gabriel tosses Constantine away and prepares to pierce Angela with the spear tip to unleash Mammon.\nDesperate, Constantine commits suicide by slitting his wrists, knowing that Lucifer will personally come to collect him. Time pauses and Constantine convinces Lucifer to intervene and stop Mammon. Gabriel attempts to smite Lucifer, but finds that he is unable to, as he no longer has divine protection. Realizing this, Lucifer burns Gabriel's wings away while also banishing Mammon back to Hell. Lucifer reluctantly offers to restore Constantine to life for his assistance, but he instead asks that Isabel be sent to Heaven. Lucifer releases Isabel and starts to drag Constantine to Hell, but Constantine instead begins ascending to Heaven for his selfless sacrifice. Infuriated, Lucifer restores Constantine to life and removes his cancer, believing that, in time, Constantine will prove he belongs in Hell. Constantine punches the now-mortal Gabriel before leaving and entrusts Angela with securing the spear tip. In a post-credits scene, Constantine visits Chas's grave and witnesses Chas in an angelic form.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nKeanu Reeves as John Constantine: A chain-smoking cynical exorcist with the ability to perceive the true visage of half-angels and half-demons on the human plane.

Chas has a strong interest in the occult and helps Constantine whenever possible in order to gain knowledge and experience from him.\nTilda Swinton as Gabriel: A \"half-breed\" Archangel with a disdain for humanity who plots to free Mammon as a means to unleash Hell on the Earth.\nPruitt Taylor Vince as Father Hennessy: An insomniac, alcoholic priest with the ability to communicate with the dead. He wears a protective charm in order to \"keep the voices out\".\nDjimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite: A former witch-doctor who once fought against Hell. After swearing an oath of neutrality \u2014 unless one side should tip the balance of power \u2014 he opened a nightclub to serve as neutral meeting ground for both sides of the war between Heaven and Hell.\nGavin Rossdale as Balthazar: A \"half-breed\" demon, and son of Lucifer. He has a special interest in, and personal history with, Constantine.\nPeter Stormare as Lucifer: A fallen Archangel who is in a proxy war with God for the souls of all mankind, and ruler of Hell. He is  feared on Earth as Satan or The Devil. Lucifer loathes Constantine with such vigor that Constantine's soul is the only one he would ever come to personally collect, due to Constantine's many fights against demons.\nMax Baker as Beeman: A friend of Constantine's with extensive knowledge of exotic occult materials and insects.

In the finished film, however, the role consists of two brief shots and one line of dialogue (\"Holy water?\") during Constantine's climactic confrontation with the group of half-breeds in the hospital. Director Francis Lawrence said Ellie's relationship with Constantine was cut to make him more of a lonely character.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe character of John Constantine was introduced by comic book writer/creator Alan Moore in The Saga of Swamp Thing #37, released in June 1985. In 1988, the character was given his own comic book title, Hellblazer, published by DC Comics.\nProducer Lauren Shuler Donner began developing the film in 1997. Paul Hunter was attached to direct in 1999, and he was replaced by Tarsem Singh in 2001. Warner Bros. hoped to begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage in the lead role, but Singh dropped out, resulting in opposing lawsuits filed by himself and Warner Bros. Keanu Reeves became attached to the film in 2002. Alan Moore, the original creator of John Constantine, was disappointed by the previous adaptations of his comics From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and refused to be credited or associated with this film, asking that his royalties be distributed among the other creators of the character.\nConstantine incorporated some elements of Garth Ennis's \"Dangerous Habits\" story arc from the comic (issues #41\u201346), and others, such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite, from the Original Sins trade paperback. The film's title was changed from Hellblazer to Constantine to avoid confusion with Clive Barker's Hellraiser films. In fact, the comic series was originally going to be titled Hellraiser, but was also retitled to avoid confusion with the first Hellraiser film, which was released a year before the debut of Hellblazer.\nThe film changed several aspects of the source material. For one, it was set in Los Angeles, rather than England, which director Francis Lawrence justified by claiming that the comic book was not exclusively set in London. Reeves played the role of John Constantine with his real-life American accent and black hair, while the character in the comics was drawn to resemble the blond musician Sting and came from Liverpool. For the film, Constantine was also given the psychic ability to see \"half-breeds\" as they truly are, and this led him to attempt suicide, causing his damnation, which, in the comics, was punishment for summoning a demon that killed a young girl. Additionally, the resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was amended so that Lucifer willingly saves the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at falling, rather than being tricked into doing so.\n\nDirector Lawrence decided to base the film's conception of Hell \"on the geography of what's around us now\". He further explained:\n\nThat was actually a combination of me and the visual effects supervisor and the production designer sitting down and sort of coming up with the biological growth that's growing all over the cars and what that looks like and the color palette. And we started to look at the nuclear test films from the 1940s of the nuclear blasts and just decided that it would be great if the landscape was not only violent with these creatures, but also the atmosphere. So we decided that it was kind of an eternal nuclear blast except nothing ever really gets obliterated because it's eternal and it's constantly going.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\n\n=== Soundtrack ===\n\nConstantine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on February 15, 2005. It is an orchestral compilation of songs from the film, performed by The Hollywood Studio Symphony & The Hollywood Film Chorale and composed by Brian Tyler, the composer for films such as Eagle Eye and Fast & Furious, and Klaus Badelt. Two songs heard in the film, \"Passive\" by A Perfect Circle (heard as Constantine walks through Midnite's bar) and \"Take Five\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet (heard on a record played by Constantine), were not included on the soundtrack.\nThe album was panned by Allmusic, who referred to it as \"clich\u00e9d and religiously formulaic\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\nThe original release date for the film was September 17, 2004, but was subsequently pushed back to February 2005. Although the film was intended to be rated PG-13, it received an R-rating from the MPAA, which Lawrence attributed to its religious overtones.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD in 2005. Warner Home Video intended to release the film on HD DVD on March 28, 2006, making it one of the earliest titles released on that media format, but, following delays to the launch of HD DVD, it actually debuted on June 6 the same year. It was released on Blu-ray Disc by Warner Home Video on October 14, 2008.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nConstantine opened in 3,006 theaters in the United States on February 18, 2005, earning $29.8 million in its opening weekend and ranking second behind Hitch's second weekend. It ended its run on June 16, having grossed $76 million in the United States and Canada, and $154.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $230.9 million, against a production budget of $70\u2013100 million.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 46% based on the reviews of 227 critics, and an average rating of 5.5/10; the site's consensus states: \"Despite solid production values and an intriguing premise, Constantine lacks the focus of another spiritual shoot-em-up, The Matrix\". On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, it has a score of 50 out of 100 based on the reviews of 41 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRichard Corliss of Time magazine called the film \"a one-of-a-kind hybrid: a theological noir action film\". He cited Keanu Reeves' ability to \"retain his charisma in a weird-silly moment\" as proof that he is a \"movie star\", and referred to Tilda Swinton as \"immaculately decadent\". Corliss also praised the variety of camera placements employed by Francis Lawrence. He was, however, critical of the climax of the film, referring to it as \"irrevocably goofy\".\nElla Taylor of LA Weekly wrote: \"Constantine, which opts in the end for what I can only describe as a kind of supernatural humanism, is not without its spiritual satisfactions\". Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times said that \"Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles\u2014he infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity\".\nPete Vonder Haar of Film Threat gave the film three stars out of five, writing that \"the film (barely) succeeds, thanks to impressive visuals, the idea of an uncaring God wagering with Satan for souls, and two immensely enjoyable scenes (one with Weisz, one with Stormare) in which Reeves actually plays his character as the cynical asshole he really is\".\nJack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film 2 out of 4 stars: \"For all its spiritual angst, Constantine is about as silly as fantasies get\". Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun also gave the film 2 stars out of 4: \"It all comes off as a case of filmmakers wanting to have their communion wafer and eat it, too\". Desson Thomson, a writer for The Washington Post, had similar sentiments of the film, specifically criticizing its differences from the comic book:\n\nIf you are a fan of the Hellblazer comic book series, on which this movie is based, you'll definitely need a distraction. The relation between Constantine and its source material is, at best, superfluous. The disparity starts with the original John Constantine (Reeves's character) being from Liverpool, England. Reeves from the city of John and Paul? As if.\nLeonard Maltin's annual publication Movie Guide gave the film a BOMB rating, describing it as \"dreary, to put it mildly\".\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave it one and a half out of four stars, panning the depiction of Hell (\"a post-nuclear Los Angeles created by animators with a hangover\"), the premise of the film itself (\"you would think that God would be the New England Patriots of this contest, but apparently there is a chance that Satan could win\"), plot holes, inconsistencies, and general actions depicted throughout the film. He was not particularly critical of the acting, only mentioning it by stating: \"Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen Hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking\". Ebert added the film to his list of \"most hated\" films.\n\n\n== Novelization, Video Game & TV Series ==\nTo tie-in to the film's release, a novelization by John Shirley and a video game adaption were produced. The novelization states that the buildings in Hell are built with the souls of the damned, rather than brick, and lined with blood, rather than mortar.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nIn 2011, director Francis Lawrence stated, regarding a sequel:\n\nIt's interesting that over the years, Constantine seems like it's become ... like it has this sort of cult following, which has been great. It's been embraced. It would be great to figure out a sequel, and if we did, and we've been trying to figure one out, it would be great to do the really dark, scary version. We got caught in that weird PG-13\u2013R no man's land, and we should do the hard-R scary version, which I would love to do.\nIn November 2012, Guillermo del Toro signed a deal to write and direct a Justice League Dark film centered around DC Comics' supernatural characters, John Constantine among them.\nReeves said in 2019 and 2021 that he was open to reprise the role in the future.\nIn November 2020, Stormare announced in a post on Instagram that a sequel was \"in the works\", though neither representatives for Warner Bros. nor Reeves immediately responded to requests for comment.\nIn September 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Warner Bros. would develop a Constantine sequel, with Keanu Reeves set to return in the lead role. Francis Lawrence was set to return as the film's director, with Akiva Goldsman writing the screenplay. Goldsman would also produce, alongside J. J. Abrams & Hannah Minghella. Reeves stated that he had spoken to DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn and was told that the sequel would still be made, being part of DC Elseworlds, a film series intended to distinguish itself from the upcoming DC Universe (DCU).\nLawrence gave an update on the project in October 2023, indicating that work had proceeded following the conclusion of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike; he, Reeves and Goldsman have been meeting and discussing the story.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nConstantine at IMDb \nConstantine at AllMovie \nConstantine at Rotten Tomatoes \nConstantine at Metacritic",
            "The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, who co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, and the story with David S. Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is the final installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy, and the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). The film stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, alongside Anne Hathaway, Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, Morgan Freeman, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Michael Caine. The film, set eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, follows the terrorist Bane (Hardy) as he forces Wayne to resume his role as Batman and save Gotham City from nuclear destruction.\nChristopher Nolan was hesitant about returning to the series for a third film, but agreed after developing a story with his brother and Goyer that he felt would conclude the series on a satisfactory note. Nolan drew inspiration from Bane's comic book debut in the 1993 \"Knightfall\" storyline, the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns, and the 1999 storyline \"No Man's Land\". Filming took place from May to November 2011 in locations including Jodhpur, London, Nottingham, Glasgow, Los Angeles, New York City, Newark, and Pittsburgh. Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming, including the first six minutes of the film, to optimize the quality of the picture. A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the \"Bat\", an underground prison set, and a new Batcave set were created specially for the film. As with The Dark Knight, viral marketing campaigns began early during production. When filming concluded, Warner Bros. refocused its campaign, developing promotional websites, releasing the first six minutes of the film, screening theatrical trailers, and sending out information regarding the film's plot.\nThe Dark Knight Rises premiered in New York City on July 16, 2012. The film was released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 20, 2012. The film received positive reviews from critics who deemed it a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. The film grossed over $1 billion worldwide, making it the second film in the Batman film series to earn $1 billion, and the highest-grossing Batman film to date. In addition to being Nolan's highest-grossing film, it became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2012. It was named one of the top 10 films of 2012 by the American Film Institute.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nBane, a former member of the League of Shadows, leads an attack on a CIA plane over Uzbekistan to abduct nuclear physicist Dr. Leonid Pavel and fake Pavel's death in the crash. Meanwhile, eight years after the death of Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent and the arrest of the Joker, organized crime has been eradicated in Gotham by the Dent Act, legislation that gives expanded powers to the police. Police commissioner James Gordon has kept Dent's killing spree a secret and allowed the blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. Bruce Wayne, still mourning the death of Rachel Dawes, has become a recluse, and Wayne Enterprises has stagnated.\nBane conspires to help Wayne Enterprises board member John Daggett take over the company, and they begin by trying to buy Bruce's fingerprints. Burglar Selina \"Catwoman\" Kyle steals Bruce's prints from Wayne Manor for Daggett, but he double-crosses her, and she alerts the police, who pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Catwoman flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to Bane, but he escapes and is found by Officer John Blake, an orphan who has deduced Bruce's secret identity and persuades him to resume his vigilantism. Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange and uses Bruce's fingerprints to verify a series of fraudulent transactions, leaving Bruce ousted from his company and bankrupt. Batman resurfaces to pursue Bane's henchmen. Fearing Bruce will get himself killed fighting Bane, his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, resigns in the hope of saving him after admitting to burning a letter that Rachel left for him saying she was going to marry Dent. Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett while Bruce and Wayne Enterprises' new CEO, Miranda Tate, become lovers.\nCatwoman agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into a trap under Wayne Tower. Bane gloats that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham City before he brutally cripples Batman in combat. He then takes Bruce to an ancient underground prison in the Middle East, where Bruce learns that Ra's al Ghul's child was born and raised in the prison but had a protector that aided the child in escaping, thought to be impossible. Back in Gotham, Bane traps the police forces in the sewers, destroys all but one bridge surrounding the city, kills Mayor Anthony Garcia, and forces Pavel to convert the fusion reactor core owned by Wayne Enterprises into a decaying neutron bomb before publicly killing him. He exposes Dent's crimes to the city and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, taking over the city, and has Gotham's elite exiled and killed in proletarian kangaroo courts presided over by Jonathan Crane.\nFive months later, Bruce escapes captivity and returns to Gotham. As Batman, he frees the police, and together, they clash with Bane's army in the streets. During the battle, Batman overpowers Bane, but Tate stabs Batman in the abdomen, revealing herself as Ra's al Ghul's daughter Talia al Ghul. Talia also reveals that Bane was her protector in the pit before activating the bomb's detonator, but it fails due to Gordon blocking the signal, so Talia leaves to find the bomb while entrusting Bane to finish off Batman. However, Catwoman returns, killing Bane and helping Batman pursue Talia, hoping to return the bomb to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman, after revealing his identity to Gordon, uses his aerial craft, the Bat, to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes.\nIn the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and honored as a hero. Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage, and Bruce's estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the Bat Signal repaired, while Lucius Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed the Bat's malfunctioning auto-pilot. In Florence, Alfred discovers that Bruce is alive and in a relationship with Selina, and they silently acknowledge each other before parting ways. Blake, whose legal first name is revealed as Robin, resigns from the GCPD and receives a package leading him to the Batcave.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nChristian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman:A billionaire socialite who dedicates himself to protecting Gotham City from its criminal underworld, as a feared vigilante. Nolan has stated that, due to the eight-year gap between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, \"he's an older Bruce Wayne; he's not in a great state.\" Bale employed a martial arts discipline called the Keysi Fighting Method, now modified for Wayne's current state and Bane's style. Bale has stated that The Dark Knight Rises would be his final Batman film. Bale acknowledged that Batman is \"not a healthy individual, this is somebody that is doing good, but he's right on the verge of doing bad\". Bale clarifies that \"He doesn't want to forget [his parents' deaths]. He wants to maintain that anger he felt at that injustice\". Bale felt bittersweet about leaving the franchise, saying that it was like \"saying goodbye to an old friend.\"\nMichael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth:Bruce's trusted butler and confidant, who acts as a father figure to Wayne but is unable to accept Wayne's desire to revive his Batman persona, even resigning from his position to impress the seriousness of his position upon him. Christopher Nolan emphasized the emotional bond between Pennyworth and Wayne, stressing its importance in the previous films and predicting that the relationship will be strained as it never has before.\nGary Oldman as James Gordon:The Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department, and one of the city's few honest police officers. Oldman described the character's work in cleaning up Gotham City as having left him world-weary and slightly bored, likening Gordon to a soldier who leaps at the chance to be on the front lines. His life has taken a turn for the worse since The Dark Knight; his wife has left him and taken their children, and the mayor is planning to dismiss him from his job. Gordon feels guilty over his role in covering up Harvey Dent's crimes and is prepared to resign from his position as Commissioner over it, but then senses that Gotham is about to come under threat.\nAnne Hathaway as Selina Kyle / Catwoman:A professional cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who establishes a playful, teasing relationship with Wayne that \"takes some of the somberness away from his character\", and pursues a \"clean slate\" (a computer program rumored to be able to erase a person's criminal history) when she crosses paths with both Wayne and Batman. Hathaway auditioned not knowing what role she was being considered for. Jessica Biel was considered for the role. Hathaway described the role as being the most physically demanding she had ever played, and confessed that while she thought of herself as being fit, she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the demands of the role. Hathaway trained extensively in martial arts for the role, and looked to Hedy Lamarr\u2014who was the initial inspiration for the comic book character\u2014in developing her own performance. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight writer David S. Goyer had previously ruled out in 2008 including Catwoman in a third film for having already appeared in Tim Burton's Batman Returns, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer.\nTom Hardy as Bane:A mysterious and physically imposing villain who was excommunicated from the League of Shadows and portrays himself as a \"liberator of pain\" and revolutionary. He is desperate to continue Ra's al Ghul's legacy by destroying Gotham. The character was chosen by Christopher Nolan because of his desire to see Batman tested on both a physical and mental level. According to costume designer Lindy Hemming, the character wears a mask that supplies him with an analgesic gas to relieve pain he suffers from an injury sustained \"early in his story\". Hardy intended to portray the character as \"more menacing\" than Robert Swenson's version of the character in Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin and that in order to do so, his portrayal entailed creating a contradiction between his voice and body. Hardy gained 30 pounds (14 kg) for the role, increasing his weight to 200 pounds (90 kg). Hardy would later said training for the role probably damaged his body. Hardy based Bane's voice on several influences, which include Bartley Gorman and the character's comic book heritage. Bane claims that his revolution's enemies are the rich and the corrupt, who he contends are oppressing \"the people\", when in reality this was a ruse in order to exploit the citizens of Gotham City for the League of Shadows' ultimate goal in destroying Gotham City.\nMarion Cotillard as Miranda Tate / Talia al Ghul:The current CEO of Wayne Enterprises who encourages a still-grieving Bruce to rejoin society and continue his father's philanthropic works but is later revealed to be the daughter of Ra's al Ghul and Bane's accomplice. Cotillard also does her own dub-over voice in both the European and Canadian French dubs of the film.\nJoey King as young Talia al Ghul\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake:A young police officer whose instincts lead him to believe that there is trouble on the horizon and is promoted to detective by Gordon when the elder cop saw something of himself within the younger. Blake represents the idealism that Gordon and Bruce once held, but soon lost in their battle against crime in the city. The film reveals his legal name to be Robin John Blake, an homage to Batman's sidekick in the comics, Robin.\nMorgan Freeman as Lucius Fox: The ex-CEO turned executive vice president of Wayne Enterprises, who runs the company on Wayne's behalf and serves as his armorer for the Batsuit, providing him with high-tech equipment and discreetly developing cutting-edge technology and weaponry, even as Wayne Enterprises starts losing money.\nMatthew Modine as Peter Foley: Gordon's second-in-command who disdains Batman.\nBen Mendelsohn as John Daggett: A rival billionaire socialite who employs Bane in his plan to take control of Wayne Enterprises.\nBurn Gorman as Philip Stryver: Daggett's assistant and senior executive vice president of Daggett Industries. Philip Stryver is named after Stryver from A Tale of Two Cities, the novel that The Dark Knight Rises directly drew influence from.\nNestor Carbonell as Anthony Garcia: Gotham City's mayor. Carbonell reprises his role from The Dark Knight.\nJuno Temple as Jen: Selina Kyle's friend and accomplice.\nJosh Stewart as Barsad: Bane's right-hand man.\nAlon Aboutboul as Dr. Leonid Pavel: A Russian nuclear physicist who is kidnapped by Bane and the League of Shadows in order to convert a fusion reactor funded by Bruce Wayne and Miranda Tate into a weapon to be used for the destruction of Gotham City.\nAidan Gillen as Bill Wilson: A CIA operative who was tasked with extracting Pavel from Uzbekistan and tracking down Bane for terrorist activities before his appearance in Gotham City. (Bill is referred to solely as \"CIA\" in the film's dialogue; the character's name is revealed in the film's novelization.)\nBrett Cullen portrays Byron Gilley, a U.S. congressman who is kidnapped by Kyle. Brett Cullen would go on to portray Thomas Wayne in the 2019 DC Comics adaptation Joker.\nChris Ellis as Father Reilly, a priest at the orphanage that Blake grew up in.\nTom Conti as Prisoner: An unnamed prisoner who serves as Bruce Wayne's caretaker in Bane's underground prison, The Pit.\nDaniel Sunjata as Mark Jones, a U.S. Special Ops officer who leads a task force into Gotham to assist Gordon and the GCPD in freeing the city from Bane's rule.\nLiam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul: Liam Neeson reprises his role from Batman Begins in a cameo appearance; he also appears in a brief flashback.\nJosh Pence as young Ra's al Ghul. He appears in scenes set thirty years before the events of Batman Begins.\nCillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane: Cillian Murphy reprises his role from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.\nIndia Wadsworth as the wife of Ra's al Ghul and the mother of Talia al Ghul.\nJohn Nolan as Douglas Fredericks, a board member of Wayne Enterprises. John Nolan is Christopher Nolan's uncle and he reprises his role from Batman Begins.\nWilliam Devane as the President of the United States.\nOther cast members include Rob Brown, Will Estes and Desmond Harrington as police officers; Christopher Judge as one of Bane's henchmen; and Noel Gugliemi as an ex-prisoner who is in charge of exiling corrupt elites during Bane's revolution. Thomas Lennon, who had appeared as a doctor in Nolan's 2000 film Memento, again plays a doctor. Glen Powell makes a pre-fame appearance as a stock exchange trader that gets knocked out by Bane.\nUnited States Senator Patrick Leahy, who had made a cameo appearance in The Dark Knight, returned in The Dark Knight Rises, as a Wayne Enterprises board member.\nSeveral members of the Pittsburgh Steelers have cameo appearances as members of the fictional Gotham Rogues football team in the film, including Ben Roethlisberger, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Willie Colon, Maurkice Pouncey, Mike Wallace, Heath Miller, Aaron Smith, Ryan Clark, James Farrior, LaMarr Woodley, and Casey Hampton, and former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher as the head coach of the Rogues. Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl, a kicker in college, appears as the kicker for the Rogues' opponents, the Rapid City Monuments.\nAaron Eckhart expressed enthusiasm in returning for a sequel if asked, although he later stated Nolan verified that his character, Harvey Dent / Two-Face, was dead, and only archive footage of Eckhart from The Dark Knight appears in the film.\nZo\u00eb Kravitz attempted to audition for a role in the film, but she was rejected for being \"too urban\". She would later go on to play Catwoman in the 2022 film The Batman.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 2005, David S. Goyer confirmed that he wrote treatments for two Batman Begins sequels involving the Joker; the first would involve Batman, Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon hunting the Joker, while the second would have the Joker scarring Dent and turning him into Two-Face during his trial. The third treatment ended in the same way as the final version of The Dark Knight Rises. Other aspects of the third treatment were incorporated into The Dark Knight. However, Heath Ledger's family stated that he was planning on reprising his role as the Joker before his death, a notion supported by Ledger's co-star Aaron Eckhart, who portrayed Two-Face in that film. A deleted subplot from The Dark Knight involved Michael Jai White's Gambol surviving his encounter with the Joker to enable Jai White's character to return in a future film to try to take Gotham City over, but these plans were scrapped after Ledger's death and the film was edited to delete Gambol's subplot and have him killed off in the scene where the Joker originally simply mutilated him. After Ledger's death, Christopher Nolan decided not to recast the role out of respect for his performance, and was initially hesitant to make a third film.\nWarner Bros. president of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film would be released in 2011 or 2012. Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. \"On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question,\" he reasoned, \"how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?\" Nolan said that he never even thought a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan only agreed to a third film based on finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors. Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.\nFollowing the success of the Joker in The Dark Knight, studio executives wished for the Riddler to be included as the primary villain as he was considered a similar character and encouraged the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, Nolan wanted the antagonist to be vastly different from the previous incarnations and committed to using Bane instead, citing the need for a character with a physical presence within the film. He was initially unfamiliar with the character's backstory, but pointed out the appeal of an archetype, labeling it as \"the extreme of some type of villainy\". When comparing the choice of Bane with the Joker, Nolan highlighted the Joker as an example of \"diabolical, chaotic anarchy and has a devilish sense of humor\", juxtaposing him against Bane, whom he likened to \"a classic movie monster [...] with a terrific brain.\" Nolan has said that his draft of the script was inspired by Charles Dickens' 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, which centers around the French Revolution. This homage to Dickens was briefly illustrated by having Bane inconspicuously finger knit paracord in the film, symbolizing Madame Defarge, the villain of A Tale of Two Cities, and more overtly by Commissioner Gordon's eulogy for Bruce Wayne, which is taken directly from Dickens' novel.\nOn February 9, 2010, it was announced that Nolan had \"cracked\" the story and was committed to returning to the project. Shortly afterward, it was announced David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan were working on a screenplay. Goyer would leave the project during pre-production to begin work on Man of Steel; Jonathan continued writing the script based on the story by his brother Chris and Goyer. Nolan said that his brother's original draft was about 400 pages. The film's storyline has been compared with the Batman comic book series' story arc \"Knightfall\" (1993), which showcases Bane; the miniseries The Dark Knight Returns (1986), in which Batman returns to Gotham City after a ten-year absence; and the story arc \"No Man's Land\" (1999), which depicts a Gotham cut off from the rest of the world and overrun by gangs. The nickname \"the Dark Knight\" was first applied to Batman in Batman #1 (1940), in a story written by Bill Finger.\nNolan confirmed the Joker would not return in the third film, and dismissed rumors that he considered using unused footage of Ledger from The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight Rises reunited Nolan with many of his past collaborators, including cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Lee Smith, costume designer Lindy Hemming, special effects supervisors Paul Franklin and Chris Corbould, and composer Hans Zimmer.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nDuring location scouting in December 2010, Nolan began searching for locations such as India, Romania, and Michigan. According to the Romania Insider, Nolan was interested in Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine. The film had an estimated budget of $250\u2013300 million, coming down to about $230 million after tax credits. Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated that he intended to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes). Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-president David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues.\nWally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX, but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35 mm and 70 mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes, as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX planned to run the film in its theatres for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks. Nolan also bypassed the use of a digital intermediate for the film, resulting in less manipulation of the filmed image and higher film resolution.\nFilming was scheduled to start in May and conclude in November 2011. Principal photography commenced on May 6, 2011, in Jodhpur, India, at the Mehrangarh Fort before moving to Pittsburgh, where it operated under the working title Magnus Rex to reduce the visibility of the production. Shooting locations within the city included Heinz Field, the site of an American football game, with members of the Pittsburgh Steelers playing the Gotham Rogues football team. More than 11,000 extras were used to depict the shot sequence. Filming in Pittsburgh also took place at the Mellon Institute and Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. A letter sent out to residents and business owners detailing road closures revealed that the streets of the city would be featured \"as the start of [the] film\". 9-1-1 operators were told to expect an increase in calls related to gunshots and explosions in the film's production.\nThe Pittsburgh leg of production wrapped after three weeks on August 21, 2011. The next portion of the filming began in Los Angeles in late August and finished up on October 23 after nine weeks of filming. New York and New Jersey were the next places of filming. The Trump Tower replaced the Richard J. Daley Center as the location for the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises. In November 2011, shooting shifted to Newark, New Jersey. Newark City Hall and Military Park were among the locations used for filming. Other shooting locations include London and Glasgow, the latter of which was used for \"additional exterior filming\". Principal photography concluded on November 14, 2011. The external waterfall scene at the end of the film was shot at Sgwd Henrhyd falls, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales.\nProduction photos from filming in Pittsburgh showed a second Tumbler chassis after the first was destroyed, indicating that a new Batmobile would be in the film, following the destruction of the first in The Dark Knight. Further set photos revealed a \"new vehicle\" being transported to Wabash Tunnel, prompting speculation as to its nature. In June 2011, Autoblog confirmed the presence of the new Lamborghini Aventador on the film set.\n\nSeveral accidents occurred during the production of the film. While filming at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, a tractor-trailer crashed into the main entrance, though no one was injured. A stuntman parachutist later crashed through the roof of a home in Cairngorm Gliding Club, Feshiebridge in Scotland, and became wedged there after a failed landing during a skydiving stunt; he was not seriously injured. While filming scenes in Pittsburgh, Hathaway's stunt double crashed into an IMAX camera while filming a sequence that required her to ride a Batpod down a flight of stairs during a riot. There were no injuries, but the camera was destroyed. A second accident took place in Pittsburgh when the truck carrying the then-unidentified vehicle later termed \"the Bat\" went off-course and crashed into a lighting array, damaging the model of the aircraft. Production was delayed while the model was repaired.\nShortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several prominent directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre for a private screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling that the use of film stock in cinema was being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; \"I wanted to give them a chance to see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [on] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one.\"\n\n\n=== Design ===\n\n\n==== Costume design ====\n\nCostume designer Lindy Hemming explained that Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, \"keeps his pain just below the threshold so he can function.\" In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look \"like an amalgam of all sorts of bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform.\" Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look \"animalistic\". Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.\nThe Batsuit consisted of 110 separate pieces, each of which had to be replicated dozens of times over the course of the production. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and high-tech sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since The Dark Knight.\nIn creating Selina Kyle's catsuit, two layers of material were used, the outer layer being polyurethane-coated spandex embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a utility belt, and thigh-high boots with spike heels.\n\n\n==== Production design ====\nConcept artist Tully Summers commented on Nolan's style of cinematography when asked about the difference between his designs for this film and fantasy-based designs for Men in Black 3: \"The difference for me was Christopher Nolan's visual style. One of the things that makes his Batman movies so compelling is their tone of plausibility. He will often prefer a raw, grittier design over one that is very sleek and product design pretty. It's sort of a practical military aesthetic. This stuff is made to work, not impress shoppers. The Dark Knight Rises is a war film.\" Producer Emma Thomas stated this Batman film has a different visual aesthetic from the first two Nolan-directed features, explaining that \"it's meant to be winter in Gotham, so that right there is going to lend a whole different look to the film.\"\nThe film introduces a vehicle that has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed \"the Bat\". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached it as if it were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to \"fit into the same family\" as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier jump jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat \"fly\", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.\nWhen designing the Batcave set, Crowley and fellow production designer Kevin Kavanaugh hit upon the idea of flooding the Batcave and having Batman's equipment, the Batsuit and a supercomputer rise from the water. Another set was designed at Cardington as an \"underground prison\", a rough-hewn labyrinth of stone cells in a vast abyss with a 120 foot (37 m) vertical shaft leading to the surface. Exteriors above the prison were filmed in Jodhpur, India, chosen because the \"forbidding landscape added to the desolation\".\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nIn an interview in October 2010, composer Hans Zimmer confirmed that he would be returning to score The Dark Knight Rises. James Newton Howard was offered to return and write the score with Zimmer as he did for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but he chose not to because he noted that the chemistry established between Zimmer and Nolan during the making of Inception would make him seem like a \"third wheel\". Zimmer included several cues from the earlier scores but explained that he wanted to go in a \"completely different direction\" for Bane's theme.\nThe film features a prevalent chant of the phrase \"Deshi Basara\". In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant to be used in the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, \"The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind.\"\nJust like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, the film's main theme consists in just two notes repeated, representing Batman's pain and guilt. Many times is also reprised in small parts \"Molossus\", Batman's main action theme in the trilogy.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe official website launched in May 2011, introducing a viral marketing campaign similar to the one used to promote The Dark Knight. The website streamed an encrypted audio file described by users as chanting. Users decrypted the audio to the Twitter hashtag, \"#TheFireRises\". Warner Bros. removed a pixel from the webpage for every tweet using the hashtag. The website revealed the first official image of Bane.\nIn July 2011, a teaser trailer leaked online before its official release with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2. The studio released the teaser three days after the leak. The trailer received mixed responses; Stephen Spencer Davis of Slate wrote that it successfully built hype, while Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant showed disappointment, claiming it was more of an \"announcement trailer\" than an actual teaser trailer. Outlaw criticized the quality, writing that a scene depicting Commissioner Gordon in a hospital bed was overly dramatic, had \"hammy\" dialogue, and was difficult to understand due to Gordon's labored breathing. Outlaw wrote that the sweeping shot of Gotham City had poor CGI and was too reminiscent of the Inception trailer. The theatrical trailer leaked online, like the teaser trailer, before being released the following week attached to theatrical prints of Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Critics noted political undertones with dialogue foreshadowing the theme of income inequality and an \"Occupy Gotham\" campaign within the world of the story. Receiving more than 12.5 million views in the first 24 hours after its release, the trailer set the record for most combined downloads from iTunes, beating the previous record held by The Avengers. However, the second trailer for The Avengers again set the record with 13.7 million downloads. Warner Bros. attached a second theatrical trailer for The Dark Knight Rises to theatrical prints of The Avengers. An \"unnamed\" Warner Brothers executive clarified that \"We see this placement as a good strategic decision. We always want our trailers to be seen with films that people want to see\u2014and a lot of people will be going to The Avengers!\" The executive also commented that the trailer will \"provide the best potential exposure for TDKR.\" Warner Bros. released the trailer online on April 30, 2012, approximately four days before they attached it to theatrical prints of The Avengers.\nContinuing a method used with The Dark Knight whereby the opening sequence of the film was attached to IMAX prints of I Am Legend seven months before release, a six-minute prologue of The Dark Knight Rises was attached to 70mm IMAX prints of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol, again approximately seven months before release. Critical reaction to the prologue was positive. Addressing the issue in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Nolan said \"I think when people see the film, things will come into focus. Bane is very complex and very interesting and when people see the finished film people will be very entertained by him.\"\n\nViral marketing campaigns for the film continued as magazine companies Empire and Wired received \"CIA documents\" concerning a \"Dr. Leonid Pavel\", with its mugshot connected to actor Alon Abutbul. According to the first document, Pavel is a missing Russian nuclear physicist, while the second document appears to be an edited transcript of a conversation discussing the handover of Dr. Pavel to the CIA by Georgian separatists, but with most of the conversation redacted. These were later shown to be plot elements of the six-minute prologue. The official Twitter account later linked to another censored document, this time, referencing \"Operation Early Bird\". A website of the same name was discovered, revealing a countdown timer. When the countdown finished, the site presented a map showing all available theaters that would be screening the film's prologue earlier than its release.\nVarious websites received a package that included a cylinder map of \"strike zones\", and a \"fire rises\" T-shirt. In April 2012, the film's official website was updated with a \"dossier\" on a suspect named \"John Doe\" also known as \"the Batman\" for an arrest, with a list of several accusations. The premise of the campaign starts when the mayor of Gotham City \"redoubles\" the effort to capture Batman and anyone supporting his return in preparation for the upcoming \"Harvey Dent Day\". The site also includes an extensive list of real-world locations where \"graffiti related to movement in support of the vigilante's return\" is located. For each tweet of a specific location marked on the list, a frame of the second theatrical trailer for the film was released on a separate website.\nIn January 2012, six months prior to the film's release, tickets for midnight IMAX showings in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles went on sale and sold out immediately. Purchased tickets surfaced for sale online for over $100, compared with their original price of $17.50.\n\nAt the American International Toy Fair, Mattel unveiled figures for Batman, Bane, Catwoman, and Batman's flying vehicle, the Bat. The Mattel figures were also released in the \"Movie Masters\" line, featuring more highly detailed and articulated presentation, and Quiktek versions that feature interchangeable accessories. Lego released building sets and mini-figures based on the film and incorporating other DC Comic characters. Additionally, Funko released a series of plush toys, Mezco Toyz released vinyl figures, and Hornby released the Batman Tumbler car. Other partners include Jakks Pacific, who created novelty and large-scale figures and plush toys, and PPW Toys, who created a Batman themed Mr. Potato Head. Various clothing items including shoes, T-shirts, hats and wallets were also produced.\nA video game of the same name was released on the same day as the release of the film for the iOS and Android devices for promoting the movie. It was made by Gameloft. The game features an open world with primary focus on stealth and combat. The combat system of the game is inspired from Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. It takes place in Gotham City, with a somewhat similar but still significantly different plot from that of the movie. IGN gave it a mediocre score of 5.5/10.\nThe film novelization, written by author Greg Cox and published by Titan Books, was released alongside the film on July 24, 2012.\nWarner Bros. partnered with Mountain Dew to do a cross-promotion that included a special paint scheme on the number 88 Chevrolet Impala owned by Hendrick Motorsports and driven by Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. On June 17, 2012, the car won the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan International Speedway. On July 4, 2012, the studio signed a deal with Formula One team Lotus F1 to have the film's logos appear on the Lotus E20s driven by Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Romain Grosjean at the 2012 British Grand Prix. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Grosjean went on to finish the race in fifth and sixth place respectively. Warner Bros. had previously followed a similar promotion at the 2008 British Grand Prix, when the now-defunct Toyota F1 carried a livery to promote The Dark Knight.\nTwo digital comic books entitled Batman Origins and The Dark Knight: Prologue were released exclusively for Nokia Lumia devices. A special movie application has also been released, featuring trailers, wallpapers, movie schedules and Batman trivias. Limited editions of the Lumia 710, Lumia 800 and Lumia 900 were also released featuring a laser-etched Batman logo.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn July 6, 2012, Warner Bros. held a special IMAX screening of The Dark Knight Rises for more than one hundred reporters and critics. However, technical issues with the computer device synchronizing the sound and picture forced the studio to postpone the screening by a day. The film later premiered on July 16 at the AMC Lincoln Square Theater in New York City, followed by a European premiere on July 18 at Leicester Square in London, England. The film was released in Australia and New Zealand on July 19, and was later released in North America and the United Kingdom on July 20.\n\n\n=== Colorado shooting ===\n\nOn July 20, 2012, during a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman wearing a gas mask opened fire inside the theater, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Police responding to the shooting apprehended a suspect later identified as 24-year-old James Eagan Holmes shortly after arriving on the scene. Initial reports stated that Holmes identified himself as \"the Joker\" at the time of his arrest, although this has been debunked.\nWarner Bros. cancelled the Paris, Mexico, and Japan premieres of The Dark Knight Rises, and suspended the film's marketing campaign in Finland. Several broadcast networks also suspended television ads for the film in the United States. The trailer for Gangster Squad, another Warner Bros. movie included in the screening of The Dark Knight Rises, was removed as it contains a scene which shows gangsters shooting submachine guns at moviegoers through the screen, similar to the shooting in Aurora.\nDirector Christopher Nolan released a public statement calling the shooting \"unbearably savage\". Other stars of the film released statements expressing their condolences, with star Christian Bale paying a personal visit to the survivors and the memorial in Aurora.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe Dark Knight Rises was released on November 28, 2012, in Hong Kong and New Zealand. On December 3, it was released in the United Kingdom, and on December 4, it was released in the United States. It is available on Blu-ray, DVD, and as a digital download. Coinciding with the release of this film, a box set of The Dark Knight Trilogy was released. The Dark Knight Rises film was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on December 19, 2017.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nHours before the midnight release of the film, several box-office analysts suggested as much as a $198 million domestic opening weekend. However, in the wake of the mass shooting during a midnight screening of the film, Warner Bros. decided to not report further box-office figures for the movie until Monday, July 23, 2012. As a result, other distributors also delayed the release of their official estimates as well. The shooting is also speculated to have hurt the ticket sales as E! Online reported that a North Carolina audience member had stated that \"this theater was kinda empty\". Some reports released on July 21, 2012, said that rival studios estimated that the film grossed $75 million to $77 million on its opening day. Warner Bros. shortly after released a statement to ABC News stating that they delayed the release of their estimates for the opening day total of the film \"out of respect for the victims and their families,\" and added \"Warner Bros. Pictures will not be reporting box office numbers for The Dark Knight Rises throughout the weekend. Box office numbers will be released on Monday.\"\nThe Dark Knight Rises earned $448.1 million in North America, and $632.9 million in other countries, summing up to a worldwide total of $1.081 billion. Worldwide, it became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time and the third-highest-grossing film of 2012. It had a worldwide opening weekend of $248.9 million. The film set a worldwide IMAX opening-weekend record with $23.8 million (overtaken by Avengers: Age of Ultron) and also broke the record for the fastest movie to make over $50 million in IMAX theatres. IMAX CEO Richard L. Gelfond explained this by claiming, \"Audiences are clearly seeking out and embracing the film the way it was meant to be seen \u2013 in IMAX.\" On the 2012 Labor Day weekend, it became the third film distributed by Warner Bros. and the thirteenth film in cinematic history to cross the $1 billion mark. The film also became the second movie (after Avatar) to reach $100 million in worldwide IMAX grosses.\n\n\n==== North America ====\nThe Dark Knight Rises opened on Friday, July 20, 2012. It earned an estimated $30.6 million in midnight showings, which was the second-highest midnight gross behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 ($43.5 million). It did, however, set an IMAX midnight-gross record with $2.3 million (overtaken by Avengers: Age of Ultron). The film made $75.8 million during its opening day, achieving, at the time, the third-highest single and opening day tally of all time. On July 23, 2012, it was announced that the film grossed $160.9 million for its debut weekend, which was the third-highest opening weekend ever, at the time, behind Marvel's The Avengers ($207.4 million) and Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2 ($169.2 million). However, it did set an opening-weekend record for a 2D film (previously held by The Dark Knight) and an IMAX opening-weekend record with $19.0 million (previously held by Marvel's The Avengers). The film also held the top spot at the box office for its second and third weekends. In North America, it is the thirteenth-highest-grossing film, the third-highest-grossing 2012 film, as well as the sixth-highest-grossing superhero film and film based on comics. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 55 million tickets in the US.\n\n\n==== Other territories ====\nOutside North America, the film opened with $88.0 million from 7,173 theaters in just 17 markets. It was in first place at the box office outside North America for four consecutive weekends. Its three largest markets are the UK, Ireland and Malta ($90.3 million), where it is the highest-grossing superhero film, China ($52.8 million) and Australia ($44.2 million).\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe Dark Knight Rises received positive reviews from critics. In a Metacritic review of year-end lists from 133 critics, 17 placed the film in their top ten. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave The Dark Knight Rises an approval rating of 87% based on 382 reviews, and a rating average of 8/10. The web site's critical consensus reads, \"The Dark Knight Rises is an ambitious, thoughtful, and potent action film that concludes Christopher Nolan's franchise in spectacular fashion.\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRobbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is \"a superhero film without a superhero\" and praising Hardy's performance as well as the film's intricate plot and narrative. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film was \"potent, persuasive and hypnotic\" and that it was \"more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.\" Phil Villarreal from OK! Magazine gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 4, saying \"It's this series' version of The Matrix Revolutions, The Godfather Part III or Caddyshack 2.\" The Playlists Todd Gilchrist wrote \"A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, The Dark Knight Rises is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself \u2013 as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope.\" IGN gave it a 9 out of 10, noting similarities in tone and theme to Batman Begins over the trilogy's second installment, The Dark Knight, but also describing Bane as \"that bit less interesting to watch\" than Ledger's Joker, despite praising his \"menacing voice\" and \"body language-driven performance\".\nFilm critic Richard Roeper gave the film an \"A\", calling it \"a majestic, gorgeous, brutal and richly satisfying epic\", and citing the final scenes of the picture as \"the best five minutes of any film this year.\" The London Film Review gave the film a B and said \"Nolan's film is a reminder that superheroes aren't merely a frivolous distraction, but an embodiment of our best selves.\"\nThe Guardian scored the film four out of five stars, calling it a film of \"granite, monolithic intensity\", yet also calling it a \"hammy, portentous affair\". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon writes \"if The Dark Knight Rises is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, stating \"the film begins slowly with a murky plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax.\"\nIt was selected for the American Film Institute's top 10 films of 2012.\nCNN's Tom Charity said the film was a \"disappointingly clunky and bombastic conclusion to a superior series\" and called it Nolan's worst film. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker says that the \"story is dense, overlong, and studded with references that will make sense only to those intimate with Nolan's previous excursions into Batmanhood\". In reaction to fan backlash to some of the negative reviews, Rotten Tomatoes chose to disable user commentary for the film leading up to its release. Some fans had threatened violence against critics while others threatened to take down the websites of movie critics who had given the film a negative review.\n\n\n=== Analysis ===\nWriting in Salon, David Sirota, a progressive political commentator, compared The Dark Knight Rises and the game Call of Duty to 1980s popular culture reflecting the political period of the time, accusing them of perpetuating a conservative agenda: \"Just as so many 1980s pop culture products reflected the spirit of the Reagan Revolution's conservative backlash, we are now seeing two blockbuster, genre-shaping products not-so-subtly reflect the Tea Party's rhetorical backlash to the powerful Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist.\" This supposed conservatism was also noted by Occupy Wall Street leader David Graeber who stated that the film \"really is a piece of anti-Occupy propaganda\". An article in Variety reported Chuck Dixon, the cocreator of the Bane character, as saying that Bane is \"far more akin to an Occupy Wall Street type if you're looking to cast him politically.\"\nCatherine Shoard of the center-left British publication The Guardian said the film \"is a quite audaciously capitalist vision, radically conservative, radically vigilante, that advances a serious, stirring proposal that the wish-fulfilment of the wealthy is to be championed if they say they want to do good.\" In contrast, liberal commentator Jonathan Chait opined in New York that \"What passes for a right-wing movie these days is The Dark Knight Rises, which submits the rather modest premise that, irritating though the rich may be, actually killing them and taking all their stuff might be excessive.\" Writing in USA Today, Bryan Alexander called Bane \"the ultimate occupier\" and reported that Christian Bale was amazed that the script had \"foreseen\" the Occupy movement.\nNolan has denied that the film criticizes the Occupy movement, and insists that none of his Batman films are intended to be political: \"I've had as many conversations with people who have seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' \u2013 well, obviously, that's not true.\"\nSlovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek pointed out that the film was inspired by the French Revolution as portrayed by novelist Charles Dickens.\n\n\n=== Internet meme ===\nIn 2011, Aidan Gillen's character in the film, CIA operative Bill Wilson, became the subject of an Internet meme popular among 4chan users known as \"Baneposting\", which references the dialogue between Wilson and Bane in the film's opening plane scene.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nThe film received numerous accolades, including a nomination for Special Visual Effects at the British Academy Film Awards, four nominations at the Critics' Choice Awards, two Satellite Awards, five Saturn Awards (winning one), and a Grammy Award. It also received nominations for five Teen Choice Awards (winning one), six MTV Movie Awards and a Kids Choice Award. It was named one of the top 10 films of 2012 by the American Film Institute.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website (Warner Bros.)\nOfficial website (DC Comics)\nThe Dark Knight Rises at IMDb\nThe Dark Knight Rises title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\nThe Dark Knight Rises at the TCM Movie Database\nThe Dark Knight Rises at AllMovie",
            "The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, from a screenplay co-written with his brother Jonathan. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to Batman Begins (2005), and the second installment in The Dark Knight trilogy. The plot follows the vigilante Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon, and district attorney Harvey Dent, who form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City. Their efforts are derailed by the Joker, an anarchistic mastermind who seeks to test how far Batman will go to save the city from chaos. The ensemble cast includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman.\nWarner Bros. Pictures prioritized a sequel following the successful reinvention of the Batman film series with Batman Begins. Christopher and Batman Begins co-writer David S. Goyer developed the story elements, making Dent the central protagonist caught up in the battle between Batman and the Joker. In writing the screenplay, the Nolans were influenced by 1980s Batman comics and crime drama films, and sought to continue Batman Begins' heightened sense of realism. From April to November 2007, filming took place with a $185 million budget in Chicago and Hong Kong, and on sets in England. The Dark Knight was the first major motion picture to be filmed with high-resolution IMAX cameras. Christopher avoided using computer-generated imagery unless necessary, insisting on practical stunts such as flipping an 18-wheel truck and blowing up a factory.\nThe Dark Knight was marketed with an innovative interactive viral campaign that initially focused on countering criticism of Ledger's casting by those who believed he was a poor choice to portray the Joker. Ledger died from an accidental prescription drug overdose in January 2008, leading to widespread interest from the press and public regarding his performance. When it was released in July, The Dark Knight received acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances\u2014particularly that of Ledger, who received many posthumous awards including Academy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actor, making The Dark Knight the first comic-book film to receive major industry awards. It broke several box-office records and became the highest-grossing 2008 film, the fourth-highest-grossing film to that time, and the highest-grossing superhero film.\nSince its release, The Dark Knight has been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever, one of the best movies of the 2000s, and one of the best films ever made. It is considered the \"blueprint\" for many modern superhero films, particularly for its rejection of a typical comic-book movie style in favor of a crime film that features comic-book characters. Many filmmakers sought to repeat its success by emulating its gritty, realistic tone to varying degrees of success. The Dark Knight has been analyzed for its themes of terrorism and the limitations of morality and ethics. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2020. A sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, concluded The Dark Knight trilogy in 2012.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA gang of masked criminals rob a mafia-owned bank in Gotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, the Joker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate Gotham's organized crime. Batman's true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's legitimate protector, as Wayne believes Dent's success will allow Batman to retire, allowing him to romantically pursue his childhood friend Rachel Dawes, despite her relationship with Dent.\nGotham's mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and Batman. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox, Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, the Joker threatens that his attacks will continue until Batman reveals his identity. He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her.\nWayne struggles to understand the Joker's motives, but his butler Alfred Pennyworth says \"some men just want to watch the world burn.\" Dent claims he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. Batman races to rescue Rachel while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in reverse. The explosives detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent's face on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and burns it, killing Lau in the process.\nWayne Enterprises accountant Coleman Reese deduces and tries to expose Batman's identity, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take the law into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his now half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and the mafia involved in Rachel's death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker's disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded.\nDent takes Gordon's family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel's death. He flips his coin to decide their fates, but Batman tackles him to save Gordon's son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs and the truth of his corruption will harm Gotham, Batman takes the blame for his death and actions and persuades Gordon to conceal the truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered letter from Rachel to Wayne that says she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero, and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nChristian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman: A wealthy socialite who as a child was traumatized by his parents' murder. Wayne secretly operates as the heroic vigilante Batman.\nMichael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth: Wayne's father-figure, trusted butler, and confidant.\nHeath Ledger as the Joker: A criminal mastermind and anarchist who is determined to sow chaos and corruption throughout Gotham.\nGary Oldman as James Gordon: One of the few honest officers in the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) who assists Batman's war on crime.\nAaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two-Face: Gotham's noble district attorney-turned-violent vigilante.\nMaggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes: Gotham's assistant district attorney and Wayne's childhood friend, who is divided between her feelings for him and for Dent.\nMorgan Freeman as Lucius Fox: Wayne Enterprises' CEO who supplies technology and equipment for Batman's campaign.\nAdditionally, Eric Roberts, Michael Jai White, and Ritchie Coster appear as crime bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen, respectively; while Chin Han portrays Lau, a Chinese criminal banker. The GCPD cast includes Colin McFarlane as commissioner Gillian B. Loeb, Keith Szarabajka and Ron Dean as detectives Stephens and Wuertz, Monique Gabriela Curnen as rookie detective Anna Ramirez and Philip Bulcock as Murphy.\nThe cast also features Joshua Harto as Wayne Enterprises employee Coleman Reese, Anthony Michael Hall as news reporter Mike Engel, N\u00e9stor Carbonell as mayor Anthony Garcia, William Fichtner as a bank manager, Nydia Rodriguez Terracina as Judge Surrillo, Tom \"Tiny\" Lister Jr. as a prisoner, Beatrice Rosen as Wayne's Russian ballerina date, and David Dastmalchian as the Joker's paranoid schizophrenic henchman Thomas Schiff. Melinda McGraw, Nathan Gamble, and Hannah Gunn portray Gordon's wife Barbara, his son James Jr., and his daughter, respectively. The Dark Knight features several cameo appearances from Cillian Murphy, who reprises his role as Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow from Batman Begins; musical performer Matt Skiba; as well as United States Senator and Batman fan Patrick Leahy, who has appeared in or voiced characters in other Batman media.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nFollowing the critical and financial success of Batman Begins (2005), the film studio Warner Bros. Pictures prioritized a sequel. Although Batman Begins ends with a scene in which Batman is presented with a joker playing card, teasing the introduction of his archenemy, the Joker, Christopher Nolan did not intend to make a sequel and was unsure Batman Begins would be successful enough to warrant one. Christopher, alongside his wife and longtime producer Emma Thomas, had never worked on a sequel film but he and co-writer David Goyer discussed ideas for a sequel during filming. Goyer developed an outline for two sequels, but Christopher remained unsure how to continue the Batman Begins narrative while keeping it consistent and relevant, though he was interested in utilizing the Joker in Begins's grounded, realistic style. Discussions between Warner Bros. Pictures and Christopher began shortly after Batman Begins's theatrical release, and development began following the production of Christopher's The Prestige (2006).\n\n\n=== Writing ===\n\nGoyer and Christopher collaborated for three months to develop The Dark Knight's core plot points. They wanted to explore the theme of escalation and the idea that Batman's extraordinary efforts to combat common crimes would lead to an opposing escalation by criminals, attracting the Joker, who uses terrorism as a weapon. The joker playing card scene in Batman Begins was intended to convey the fallacy of Batman's belief his war on crime would be temporary. Goyer and Christopher did not intentionally include real-world parallels to terrorism, the war on terror, and laws enacted to combat terrorists by the United States government because they believed making overtly political statements would detract from the story. They wanted it to resonate with and reflect contemporary audiences. Christopher described The Dark Knight as representative of his own \"fear of anarchy\" and Joker represents \"somebody who wants to just tear down the world around him.\"\nAlthough he was a fan of Batman (1989), starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Goyer did not consider Nicholson's portrayal scary and wanted The Dark Knight's Joker to be an unknowable, already-formed character, similar to the shark in Jaws (1975), without a \"clich\u00e9\" origin story. Christopher and Goyer did not give their Joker an origin story or a narrative arc, believing it made the character scarier; Christopher described their film as the \"rise of the Joker\". They felt the threat of cinematic villains such as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader had been undermined by subsequent films depicting their origins.\nWith Christopher's help, his brother Jonathan spent six months developing the story into a draft screenplay. After submitting the draft to Warner Bros., Jonathan spent a further two months refining it until Christopher had finished directing The Prestige. The pair collaborated on the final script over the next six months during pre-production for The Dark Knight. Jonathan found the \"poignant\" ending the script's most interesting aspect; it had always depicted Batman fleeing from police but was changed from him leaping across rooftops to escaping on the Batpod, his motorcycle-like vehicle. The dialogue Jonathan considered most important, \"you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\", came late in development. Influenced by films such as The Godfather (1972) and Heat (1995), and maintaining Batman Begins's tone, their finished script bore more resemblance to a crime drama than a traditional superhero film.\nComic-book influences included writer Frank Miller's 1980s works, which portray characters in a serious tone, and the limited series Batman: The Long Halloween (1996\u20131997), which explores the relationship between Batman, Dent, and Gordon. Dent was written as The Dark Knight's central character, serving as the center of the battle between Batman, who believes Dent is the hero the city needs, and the Joker, who wants to prove even the most righteous people can be corrupted. Christopher said the title refers to Dent as much as Batman. He considered Dent as having a duality similar to Batman's, providing interesting dramatic potential.\nFocusing on Dent meant Bruce Wayne / Batman was written as a generally static character who did not undergo drastic character development. Christopher found writing the Joker the easiest aspect of the script. The Nolans identified the traits common to his media incarnations and were influenced by the character's comic-book appearances as well as the villain Dr. Mabuse from the films of Fritz Lang. Writer Alan Moore's graphic novel, Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), did not influence the main narrative but Christopher believed his interpretation of the Joker as someone partially driven to prove anyone can become like him when pushed far enough helped the Nolans give purpose to an \"inherently purposeless\" character. The Joker was written as a purely evil psychopath and anarchist who lacks reason, logic, and fear, and could test the moral and ethical limits of Batman, Dent, and Gordon. Christopher and Jonathan later realized they had inadvertently written their version similarly to Joker's first appearance in Batman #1 (1940). The final scene, in which the Joker states he and Batman are destined to battle forever, was not intended to tease a sequel but to convey the diametrically opposed pair were in an endless conflict because they will not kill each other.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nDescribing how his character had evolved from Batman Begins, Christian Bale said Wayne had changed from a young, naive, and angry man seeking purpose to a hero who is burdened by the realization his war against crime is seemingly endless. Because the new Batsuit allowed him to be more agile, Bale did not increase his muscle mass as much as he had for Batman Begins. Christopher had deliberately obscured combat in the previous film because it was intended to portray Batman from the criminals' point of view. The improved Batsuit design let him show more of Bale's Keysi-fighting method training.\nChristopher was aware that Nicholson's popular portrayal of the Joker would invite comparisons to his version, and wanted an actor who could cope with the associated scrutiny. Ledger's casting in August 2006 was criticized by some industry professionals and members of the public who considered him inappropriate for the role; executive producer Charles Roven said Ledger was the only person seriously considered, and that Batman Begins's positive reception would help alleviate any concerns. Christopher was confident in the casting because discussions between himself and Ledger had demonstrated they shared similar ideas regarding the Joker's portrayal. Ledger said he had some trepidation in succeeding Nicholson in the role but that the challenge excited him. He described his interpretation as a \"psychopathic, mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy\", and avoided humanizing him. He was influenced by Alex from the crime film A Clockwork Orange (1971), and British musicians Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious.\nLedger spent about a month secluding himself in a hotel room while reading relevant comic books. He developed the character's voice by mixing a high-pitch and low-pitch, which was inspired by ventriloquist performances. His fighting style was designed to appear improvised and erratic. Ledger spent a further four months creating a \"Joker diary\" containing images and elements he believed would resonate with his character, such as finding the disease AIDS humorous. Describing his performance, Ledger said: \"It's the most fun I've had with a character and probably will ever have ... It was an exhausting process. At the end of the day, I couldn't move. I couldn't talk. I was absolutely wrecked.\" In a November 2007 interview, Ledger said when committing himself to any role, he had difficulty sleeping because he could not relax his mind, and often slept only two hours a night during filming.\nChristopher wanted to cast an actor with an all-American \"heroic presence\" for Harvey Dent, something he likened to Robert Redford but with an undercurrent of anger or darkness. Josh Lucas, Ryan Phillippe, and Mark Ruffalo were considered, as well as Matt Damon, who could not commit due to scheduling conflicts. According to Christopher, Eckhart had the all-American charm and \"aura ... of a good man pushed too far\". Eckhart found portraying conflicted characters to be interesting; he said the difference between Dent and Batman is the distance they are willing to go for their causes, and that after Dent's corruption he remains a crime fighter but he takes this to an extreme because he dislikes the restrictions of the law. Eckhart's performance was influenced by the Kennedy family, particularly Robert F. Kennedy, who fought organized crime with a similarly idealistic view of the law. During discussions on the portrayal of Dent's transformation into Two-Face, Eckhart and Christopher agreed to ignore Tommy Lee Jones's \"colorful\" portrayal in Batman Forever (1995), in which the character has pink hair and wears a split designer suit, in favor of a more realistic, slightly burnt, neutral-toned suit.\nDescribing his role as GCPD Lieutenant James Gordon, Oldman said Gordon is the \"moral center\" of The Dark Knight, an honest and incorruptible character struggling with the limits of his morality. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, as Holmes chose to star in the crime comedy Mad Money (2008) instead. Gyllenhaal approached Rachel as a new character and did not reference Holmes's previous performance. Christopher described Rachel as the emotional connection between Wayne and Dent, ultimately serving as a further personal loss to fuel Wayne's character. Gyllenhaal collaborated with Christopher on the character's depiction because she wanted Rachel to be important and meaningful in her relatively minor role. Musician Dwight Yoakam turned down a role as the bank manager or a corrupt police officer because he was recording his album Dwight Sings Buck (2007). Hong Kong actor Edison Chen had a role in the film, but this was mostly cut following his involvement in a sex photo scandal.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn October 2006, location scouting for Gotham City took place in the UK in Liverpool, Glasgow, London, and parts of Yorkshire, and in several cities in the U.S. Christopher chose Chicago because he liked the area and believed it offered interesting architectural features without being as recognizable as locations in better-known cities such as New York City. Chicagoan authorities had been supportive during filming of Batman Begins, allowing the production to shut stretches of roads, freeways, and bridges. Christopher wanted to exchange the more natural, scenic settings of Batman Begins such as the Himalayas and caverns for a modern, structured environment the Joker could disassemble. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the clean, neat lines of Chicagoan architecture enhanced the urban-crime drama they wanted to make, and that Batman had helped improve the city. The destruction of Wayne Manor in Batman Begins provided an opportunity to move Wayne to a modern, sparse penthouse, reflecting his loneliness. Sets were still used for some interiors such as the Bat Bunker, the replacement for the Batcave, on the outskirts of the city. The production team considered placing it in the penthouse basement but believed it was too unrealistic a solution.\nMuch of The Dark Knight was filmed using Panavision's Panaflex Millennium XL and Platinum cameras but Christopher wanted to film about 40 minutes with IMAX cameras, a high-resolution technology using 70 mm film rather than the more-commonly used format 35 mm; the finished film includes 15\u201320% IMAX footage, running for about 28 minutes. This made it the first major motion picture to use IMAX technology, which was generally employed for documentaries. Warner Bros. was reluctant to endorse the use of the technology because the cameras were large and unwieldy, and purchasing and processing the film stock cost up to four times as much as typical 35 mm film. Christopher said cameras that could be used on Mount Everest could be used for The Dark Knight, and had cinematographer Wally Pfister and his crew begin training to use the equipment in January 2007 to test its feasibility. Christopher particularly wanted to film the bank heist prologue in IMAX to immediately convey the difference in scope between The Dark Knight and Batman Begins.\n\n\n=== Filming in Chicago ===\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 18, 2007, in Chicago on a $185 million budget. For The Dark Knight, Pfister chose to combine the \"rust-style\" visuals of Batman Begins with the \"dusk\"-like color scheme of The Prestige (cobalt blues, greens, blacks, and whites), in part to address over-dark scenes in Batman Begins. To avoid attention, filming in Chicago took place under the working title Rory's First Kiss but the production's true nature was quickly uncovered by media publications. The Joker's homemade videos were filmed and mainly directed by Ledger. Caine said he forgot his lines during a scene involving one video because of Ledger's \"stunning\" performance.\nThe first scene filmed was the bank heist, which was shot in the Old Chicago Main Post Office over five days. It was scheduled early to test the IMAX procedure, allowing it to be refilmed with traditional cameras if needed, and it was intended to be publicly released as part of the marketing campaign. Pfister described it as a week of patience and learning because of the four-day wait for the IMAX footage to be processed. Filming moved to England throughout May, returning to Chicago in June.\nFilming took place in the lobby of One Illinois Center, which served as Wayne's penthouse apartment; bookcases were built to hide the elevators. A floor of Two Illinois Center was decorated for Wayne's fundraiser. The crew was described as excited as this scene depicted the first meeting between Batman and the Joker. The windows in both settings were covered in green screen material, allowing Gotham City visuals to be added later. In July, three weeks were spent filming the truck chase scene, mainly on Wacker Drive, a multi-level street that had to be closed overnight. During filming, Christopher added a set-piece of a SWAT van crashing through a concrete barricade. The sequence continued on LaSalle Street, which was also used for the GCPD funeral procession, for a practical truck-flip stunt and helicopter sequence. Additional segments were filmed on Monroe Street and Randolph Street, and at Randolph Street Station.\nNavy Pier, along the shore of Lake Michigan, served as Gotham Harbor in a climactic ferry scene. Scouts spent over a month searching for suitable vessels but were unsuccessful, so construction coordinator Joe Ondrejko and his team built ferry facades atop barges. The entire sequence was filmed in one day and involved 800 extras, who were moved through makeup and clothing departments in shifts. Exterior footage of the Gotham Prewitt Building, the site of Batman's and the Joker's final confrontation, was filmed at the in-construction Trump International Hotel and Tower. The owners refused permission to film a stunt in which Batman suspends a SWAT team from the building, so this was filmed from the fortieth floor of a separate building site. A former Brach's candy factory on Cicero Avenue scheduled for demolition was used to film the Gotham General Hospital explosion in August 2007. Filming in Chicago concluded on September 1, ending with scenes of Wayne driving and crashing his car, before the production returned to England.\nThe Dark Knight includes Chicago locations such as Lake Michigan, which doubled as the Caribbean Sea where Wayne boards a seaplane; Richard J. Daley Center (Wayne Enterprises exteriors and a courtroom); The Berghoff restaurant (GCPD arresting mobsters); Twin Anchors restaurant; the Sound Bar; McCormick Place (Wayne Enterprises interiors); and Chicago Theatre. 330 North Wabash served as offices used by Dent, mayor Garcia, and commissioner Loeb; and its thirteenth floor appears as Wayne Enterprises' boardroom; Pfister enhanced its large, panoramic windows and natural light with an 80-foot (24 m) glass table and reflective bulbs. A Randolph Street parking garage is where Batman captures Scarecrow and Batman impersonators. Christopher wanted several Rottweiler dogs in the scene but locating a dog-handler willing to simultaneously manage several dogs was difficult. A scene of Batman surveying the city from a rooftop edge was filmed atop Willis Tower, Chicago's tallest building. Stuntman Buster Reeves was due to double as Batman, but Bale persuaded the filmmakers to let him perform the scene himself. The thirteen weeks of filming in Chicago was estimated to have generated $45 million for the city's economy and thousands of local jobs.\n\n\n=== Filming in England and Hong Kong ===\n\nMany interior locations for The Dark Knight were filmed on sets at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, and Cardington Airfield, Bedfordshire; these locations include the Bat Bunker, which took six weeks to build in a Cardington hangar. The Bat Bunker was based on 1960s Chicago building designs, and was integrated into existing concrete floor, and used the 200-foot (61 m) long, 8 ft (2.4 m) tall ceiling to create a broad perspective. The 160-foot (49 m) tall hangar was unsuitable for suspending the bunker roof, and an encompassing gantry was built to hold it and the lighting. After moving from Chicago in May, scenes filmed in the UK also include Criterion Restaurant, where Rachel, Dent, and Wayne share dinner, and a Gotham News scene that was filmed at the University of Westminster. The GCPD headquarters was rebuilt in the Farmiloe Building. During the interrogation scene, Ledger asked Bale to actually hit him, and although he declined, Ledger cracked and dented the walls by throwing himself around.\nAfter returning to England in the middle of September, scenes were filmed for the ferry, hospital, and Gotham Prewitt building interiors. By mid-October, interior and exterior scenes of Rachel being held hostage surrounded by barrels of gasoline were filmed at Battersea Power Station. To avoid damaging the power station, a listed building, a false wall was built in front of it and lined with explosives. Nearby residents contacted emergency services believing the explosion was a terrorist attack. Filming in England concluded at the end of October with a variety of green-screen shots for the truck-chase sequence, and shots of Rachel being thrown from a window were filmed on a set at Cardington.\nThe final nine days of production took place in Hong Kong and included aerial footage from atop the International Finance Centre, as well as filming at Central to Mid-Levels escalator, The Center, Central, The Peninsula Hong Kong, and Queen's Road; and a stunt involving Batman catching an in-flight C-130 aircraft. Despite extensive rehearsals of Reeves jumping from the McClurg Building in Chicago, a planned stunt to depict Batman leaping from one Hong Kong skyscraper to another was canceled because local authorities refused permission for helicopter use; Pfister described the officials as a \"nightmare\". Christopher disputed a report that said a scene of Batman leaping into Victoria Harbour was canceled because of pollution concerns, saying it was a script decision. The 127-day shoot concluded on November 15, on time and under budget.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nEditing was underway in January 2008 when Ledger, aged 28, died from an accidental overdose of a prescription drug. A rumor his commitment to his performance as the Joker had affected his mental state circulated, but this was later refuted. Christopher said editing the film became \"tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day [during editing] ... but the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish\". Because Christopher preferred to capture sound while filming rather than re-recording dialogue in post-production, Ledger's work had been completed before his death, and Christopher did not modify the Joker's narrative in response. Christopher added a dedication to Ledger and stuntman Conway Wickliffe, who died during rehearsals for a Tumbler (Batmobile) stunt.\nAlongside lead editor Lee Smith, Christopher took an \"aggressive editorial approach\" to editing The Dark Knight to achieve its 152-minute running time. Christopher said no scenes were deleted because he believed every scene was essential, and that unnecessary material had been cut before filming. The Nolans had difficulties refining the script to reduce the running time. After removing so much material they believed the story had become incomprehensible, they added more scenes.\n\n\n=== Special effects and design ===\n\nUnlike the design process of Batman Begins, which was restrained by a need to represent Batman iconography, audience acceptance of its realistic setting gave The Dark Knight more design freedom. Chris Corbould, the film's special effects supervisor, oversaw the 700 effect shots Double Negative and Framestore produced; there were relatively few effects compared to equivalent films because Christopher only used computer-generated imaging where practical effects would not suffice. Production designer Nathan Crowley designed the Batpod (Batcycle) because Christopher did not want to extensively re-use the Tumbler. Corbould's team built the Batpod, which is based on a prototype Crowley and Christopher built by combining different commercial model components. The unwieldy, wide-tired vehicle could only be ridden by stuntman Jean Pierre Goy after months of training. The Gotham General Hospital explosion was not in the script but added during filming because Corbould believed it could be done.\nHemming, Crowley, Christopher, and Jamie Rama re-designed the Batsuit to make it more comfortable and flexible, developing a costume made from a stretchy material covered in over 100 urethane armor pieces. Sculptor Julian Murray developed Dent's burnt-facial design, which is based on Christopher's request for a skeletal appearance. Murray went through designs that were \"too real and more horrifying\" before settling on a more \"fanciful\" and detailed but less-repulsive version. Hemming designed Joker's overall appearance, which he based on fashion-and-music celebrities to create a modern and trendy look. Influence also came from the 1953 painting Study after Vel\u00e1zquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X by Francis Bacon\u2014suggested by Christopher\u2014and the character's comic-book appearances. The outfit consists of a purple coat, a green vest, an antique shirt, and a thin, 1960s-style tie that Ledger suggested. Prosthetics supervisor Conor O'Sullivan created Joker's scars, which he partly based on a scarred delivery man he met, and used his own technique to create and apply the supple, skin-like prosthesis. John Caglione Jr designed Joker's \"organic\" makeup to look as though it had been worn for days; this idea was partly based on more of Bacon's works. Caglione Jr used a theatrical makeup technique for the application; he instructed Ledger to scrunch up his face so different cracks and textures were created once the makeup was applied and Ledger relaxed. Ledger always applied the lipstick himself, believing it was essential to his characterization.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nComposers James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, who had also worked on Batman Begins, scored The Dark Knight because Christopher believed it was important to bridge the musical-narrative gap between the films. The score was recorded at Air Studios, London. Howard and Zimmer composed the score without seeing the film because Christopher wanted them to be influenced by the characters and story rather than fitting specific on-screen elements. Howard and Zimmer separated their duties by character; Howard focused on Dent and Zimmer focused on Batman and the Joker. Zimmer did not consider Batman to be strictly noble and wrote the theme to not seem \"super\". Howard wrote about ten minutes of music for Dent, wanting to portray him as an American who represents hope, but undergoes an emotional extreme and moral corruption. He used brass instruments for both moral ends but warped the sound as Dent is corrupted.\nZimmer wanted to use a single note for the Joker's theme; he said, \"imagine one note that starts off slightly agitated and then goes to serious aggravation and finally rips your head off at the end\". He could not make it work, however, and used two notes with alternating tempos and a \"punk\" influence. The theme was influenced by electronic music innovators Kraftwerk and Zimmer's work with rock band The Damned. He wanted to convey elements of the Joker's corrosion, recklessness, and \"otherworldliness\" by combining electronic and orchestral music, and modifying almost every note after recording to emulate sounds including thunder and razors. He attempted to develop original sounds with synthesizers, trying to create an \"offputting\" result by instructing musicians to start with a single note and gradually shift to the second over a three-minute period; the musicians found this difficult because it was the opposite of their training. It took several months to achieve Zimmer's desired result. Following Ledger's death, Zimmer considered discarding the theme for a more traditional one but he and Howard believed they should honor Ledger's performance.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Marketing and anti-piracy ===\n\nThe Dark Knight's marketing campaign was developed by alternate reality game (ARG) development company 42 Entertainment. Christopher wanted the team to focus on countering the negative reaction to Ledger's casting and controlling the revelation of the Joker's appearance. Influenced by the script and the comic books The Killing Joke, The Long Halloween, and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth (1989), 42 Entertainment paced the ARG over annual events, although Warner Bros. rejected their ideas to use Jokerized Santas at Christmas, coffins filled with chattering teeth on Mother's Day (mocking Wayne's late mother), and Batman actors on rooftops due to safety concerns.\nThe ARG began in May 2007 with campaign posters for Dent and Joker playing cards bearing the phrase \"I believe in Harvey Dent\" were hidden inside comic books at stores around the U.S. This led people to a website where they could submit their e-mail addresses to reveal a pixel of a concealed Joker image; about 97,000 e-mail addresses and 20 hours were required to reveal the image in full, which was well received. At San Diego Comic-Con, 42 Entertainment modified 11,000 one-dollar bills with the Joker's image and the phrase \"Why So Serious?\" that led finders to a location. 42 Entertainment's initial plan to throw the bills from a balcony was canceled due to safety concerns, so the bills were covertly distributed to attendees. Although the event was expected to attract a few thousand people, 650,000 arrived and participated in activities that included calling a number taken from a plane flying overhead and wearing Joker makeup to commit disruptive acts with actors. Globally, fans photographed letters on signs to form a ransom note. A U.S.-centric effort involved people recovering cellphones made by Nokia\u2014a brand partner to the film\u2014from a cake, which led to an early screening of the film's bank-heist prologue before its public release in December. Ledger's appearance in the prologue was well-received and positively changed the discourse around his casting.\nFollowing Ledger's death, the campaign continued unchanged with a focus on Dent's election, which was influenced by the ongoing 2008 United States presidential election. Warner Bros. was concerned public knowledge of Dent's character was poor; the campaign included signs, stickers, and \"Dentmobiles\" visiting U.S. cities to raise his profile. The campaign concluded in July with displays of the Bat-Signal in Chicago and New York City that were eventually defaced by the Joker. Industry professionals considered the campaign innovative and successful.\nWarner Bros. dedicated six months to anti-piracy methods; the film industry lost an estimated $6.1 billion to piracy in 2005. Delivery methods of film reels were randomized and copies had a chain of custody to track who had access. Some theater staff were given night-vision goggles to identify people recording The Dark Knight, and one person was caught in Kansas City. Warner Bros. considered its strategy a success, delaying the appearance of the first \"poorly-lit\" camcorder version until 38\u201348 hours after its earliest global release in Australia.\n\n\n=== Context ===\n\nCompared to 2007's $9.7 billion box-office take, in 2008, lower revenues were expected due to the large number of comedies competing against each other and the release of films with dark tones, such as The Dark Knight, during a period of rising living costs and election fatigue in the U.S. Fewer sequels, which generally performed well, were scheduled and only four\u2014The Dark Knight, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\u2014were predicted to be blockbusters. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was the only film expected to easily earn over $300 million.\nThe Dark Knight was expected to sell well based on high audience anticipation, positive pre-release reviews, and a record $3.5 million in IMAX pre-sales. Predictions placed its opening-weekend take above that of Iron Man's $102.1 million but below that of Spider-Man 3's (2007) record $151.1 million. Analysts said its success would be influenced by the lengthy running time that limited the number of screenings per day, and counter-programming from the romantic comedy Mamma Mia!\u2014which surveyed well with women\u2014and the family comedy Space Chimps. There was also a perceived limit on financial success for Batman films; the 1989 installment remained the franchise's highest-grossing release. The Dark Knight's premiere took place on July 14, in IMAX in New York City. A block in Broadway was closed for the event, which included a live performance of the film score by Howard and Zimmer. The Hollywood Reporter said Ledger received several ovations, and that during the after-party, Warner Bros. executives struggled to maintain a balance between celebrating the successful response and commemorating Ledger.\n\n\n=== Box office ===\n\nOn July 18, 2008, The Dark Knight was widely released in the U.S. and Canada in a record 4,366 theaters on an estimated 9,200 screens. It earned $158.4 million during the weekend, a per-theater average of $36,282, breaking Spider-Man 3's record and making it the number-one film ahead of Mamma Mia! ($27.8 million) and Hancock ($14 million) in its third weekend. It set further records for the highest-grossing single-day ($67.2 million on the Friday), Sunday ($43.6 million), midnight opening ($18.5 million, from 3,000 midnight screenings), and IMAX opening ($6.3 million from about 94 locations), as well as the second-highest-grossing Saturday ($47.7 million) behind Spider-Man 3, and contributed to the highest-grossing weekend on record ($253.6 million). The film benefited from repeat viewings by younger audiences and had broad appeal, with 52% of the audience being male and an equal number of those under 25 years old, and those of 25 or older.\nThe Dark Knight broke more records, including for the highest-grossing opening week ($238.6 million), and for three-, four-, five-, six-, seven-, eight-, nine-, and ten-day cumulative grosses, including the highest-grossing non-holiday Monday ($24.5 million) and non-opening Tuesday ($20.9 million, as well as the second-highest-grossing non-opening Wednesday ($18.4 million), behind Transformers ($29.1 million). It retained the number-one position in its second weekend with a total gross of $75.2 million, ahead of the debuting Step Brothers ($31 million), giving it the highest-grossing second weekend. It retained the number-one position in its third ($42.7 million) and fourth ($26.1 million) weekends, before falling to second place in its fifth, with a gross of $16.4 million, behind the debuting Tropic Thunder ($25.8 million). The Dark Knight remained in the top-ten highest-grossing films for ten weeks, and became the film to surpass $400 million soonest (18 days) and $500 million (45 days). The film was playing in fewer than 100 theaters when it received a 300-theater relaunch in late January 2009 to raise its profile during nominations for the 81st Academy Awards. This raised its total box office to $533.3 million before it left theaters on March 5 after 33 weeks, making it the highest-grossing comic-book, superhero, and Batman film; the highest-grossing film of 2008; and the second-highest-grossing film ever (unadjusted for inflation), behind the 1997 romantic drama Titanic ($600.8 million).\nThe Dark Knight was released in Australia and Taiwan on Wednesday, July 16, 2008, and opened in twenty markets by the weekend. It earned about $40 million combined, making it second to Hancock ($44.8 million), which was playing in nearly four times as many countries. The Dark Knight was available in sixty-two countries by the end of August, although Warner Bros. decided not to release it in China, blaming \"a number of pre-release conditions ... as well as cultural sensitivities to some elements of the film\". The Dark Knight earned about $469.7 million outside the U.S. and Canada, its highest grosses coming from the United Kingdom ($89.1 million), Australia ($39.9 million), Germany ($29.7 million), France ($27.5 million), Mexico ($25 million), South Korea ($24.7 million), and Brazil ($20.2 million). This made it the second-highest-grossing film of the year behind Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\nThe film had grossed $997 million worldwide by January 2009. Its reissue in the run-up to the Oscars enabled the film to exceed $1 billion in February, and it ultimately earned $1.003 billion. It was the first superhero film to gross over $1 billion, the highest-grossing film of 2008 worldwide, the fourth film to earn more than $1 billion, and the fourth-highest-grossing film of its time behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest ($1.066 billion), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ($1.119 billion), and Titanic ($1.842 billion). As of September 2022, rereleases have further raised its box-office take to $1.006 billion.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\n\nThe Dark Knight received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 347 critics, with an average score of 8.6/10. The consensus reads; \"Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nSeveral publications called The Dark Knight the best comic-book hero adaptation ever made. Roger Ebert said it, alongside Iron Man, had redefined the potential of superhero films by combining comic-book tropes with real world events. Some appreciated its complex moral tale about the effects of vigilantism and terrorism on contemporary society. Emanuel Levy and Manohla Dargis praised the depiction of the characters as possessing both positive and negative aspects, such as Batman's efforts to end crime provoking unintended consequences and a greater response from criminals; Dargis believed The Dark Knight's exploration of chaos, fear, and death, following the September 11 attacks in 2001, represented \"that American movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes or maybe just superness.\" Others criticized the dark, grim, intense, and self-serious tone as lacking any elements of fun or fantasy. David Denby said The Dark Knight was a product of a \"time of terror\", but focused on embracing and unleashing it while cynically setting up a sequel. Stephanie Zacharek and David Edelstein criticized a perceived lack of visual storytelling in favor of exposition, and aspects of the plot being difficult to follow amid the fast pace and loud score. Christopher's action direction was criticized, especially during fight scenes where it could be difficult to see things clearly, although the prologue bank heist was praised as among the film's best.\nLedger's performance received near-unanimous praise with the caveat that his death made the role both highly anticipated and difficult to watch. Dargis, among others, described Ledger as realizing the Joker so convincingly, intensely, and viscerally it made the audience forget about the actor behind the makeup. The Village Voice wrote the performance would have made Ledger a legend even if he had lived. Other reviews said Ledger outshone Nicholson's performance with macabre humor and malevolence. Reviews generally agreed the Joker was the best-written character, and that Ledger commanded scenes from the entire cast to create one of the most mesmerizing cinematic villains. Zacharek, however, lamented that the performance was not in service of a better film.\nBale's reception was mixed; his performance was considered to be alternately \"captivating\" or serviceable, but ultimately uninteresting and undermined by portraying an immovable and generally unchanged character who delivers Batman's dialogue in a hoarse, unvarying tone. Eckhart's performance was generally well received; reviewers praised his portrayal of Dent as charismatic, and the character's subsequent transformation into a sad, bitter \"monster\", although Variety considered his subplot the film's weakest. Stephen Hunter said the Dent character was underwritten and that Eckhart was incapable of portraying the role as intended. Several reviewers regarded Gyllenhaal as an improvement over Holmes, although others said they found difficulty caring about the character and that Gyllenhaal, while more talented than her predecessor, was miscast. Peter Travers praised Oldman's skill in making a virtuous character interesting and he, among others, described Caine's and Freeman's performances as \"effortless\". Ebert surmised the entire cast provided \"powerful\" performances that engage the audience, such that \"we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nThe Dark Knight appeared on several lists recognizing the best films of 2008, including those compiled by Ebert, The Hollywood Reporter, and the American Film Institute. At the 13th Satellite Awards, The Dark Knight received one award for Sound Editing or Mixing (Richard King, Lora Hirschberg, Gary Rizzo). A further four wins came at the 35th People's Choice Awards: Favorite Movie, Favorite Cast, Favorite Action Movie, and Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Bale and Ledger), as well as Best Action Movie and Best Supporting Actor (Ledger) at the 14th Critics' Choice Awards. Howard and Zimmer were recognized for Best Motion Picture Score at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. Ledger won the film's only awards at the 15th Screen Actors Guild Awards, 62nd British Academy Film Awards, and 66th Golden Globe Awards, for Best Supporting Actor. At the 14th Empire Awards, The Dark Knight received awards for Best Film, Best Director (Christopher Nolan), and Best Actor (Bale). Ledger received the award for Best Villain at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, and at the 35th Saturn Awards, The Dark Knight won awards for Best Action or Adventure Film, Best Supporting Actor (Ledger), Best Writing (Christopher and Jonathan Nolan), Best Music (Howard and Zimmer), and Best Special Effects (Corbould, Nick Davis, Paul J. Franklin, Timothy Webber).\nBefore The Dark Knight's release, film industry discourse focused on Ledger potentially earning an Academy Award nomination at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, making him only the seventh person to be nominated posthumously, and if the decision would be influenced by his death or performance. Genre films such as those based on comic books were also generally ignored by Academy voters. Even so, Ledger was considered a favorite to earn the award based on praise from critic groups and his posthumous Golden Globe award. Ledger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, making him only the second performer to win an award posthumously (after Peter Finch in 1977), and The Dark Knight the first comic book adaptation to win an academy acting award. The Dark Knight also won an award for Best Sound Editing (King), and received six nominations for Best Art Direction (Crowley and Peter Lando), Best Cinematography (Pfister), Best Film Editing (Smith), Best Makeup (Caglione Jr. and O'Sullivan), Best Sound Mixing (Hirschberg, Rizzo, and Ed Novick), and Best Visual Effects (Davis, Corbould, Webber, and Franklin).\nDespite the success of The Dark Knight, the lack of a Best Picture nomination was criticized and described as a \"snub\" by some publications. The response was seen as the culmination of several years of criticism toward the academy ignoring high-performing, broadly popular films. The backlash was such that, for the 82nd Academy Awards awards in 2010, the academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as \"The Dark Knight Rule\". It allowed for more broadly popular but \"respected\" films to be nominated, including District 9, The Blind Side, Avatar, and Up, the first animated film to be nominated in two decades. This change is seen as responsible for the first Best Picture nomination of a comic book adaptation, Black Panther (2018). Even so, The Hollywood Reporter argued the academy mistook the appeals to recognize important, \"generation-defining\" genre films with just nominating more films.\n\n\n== Other releases ==\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe Dark Knight was released on DVD and Blu-ray in December 2008. The release has a slipcover box-art that revealed a \"Jokerized\" version underneath, and contains featurettes on Batman's equipment, the psychology used in the film, six episodes of the fictional news program Gotham Tonight, and a gallery of concept art, posters, and Joker cards. The Blu-ray disc version additionally offers interactive elements describing the production of some scenes. A separate, limited-edition Blu-ray disc set came with a Batpod figurine. The Dark Knight sold 3 million copies across both formats on its launch day in the U.S., Canada, and the UK; Blu-ray discs comprised about 25\u201330% of the sales\u2014around 600,000 units. The film was released at the beginning of the Blu-ray disc format; it was considered a success, breaking Iron Man's record of 250,000 units sold and indicating the format was growing in popularity. In 2011, it also became the first major-studio film to be released for rent via digital distribution on Facebook. A 4K resolution remaster, which was overseen by Christopher, was released in December 2017 as a set containing a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray disc, and digital download, as well as special features from earlier releases.\n\n\n=== Merchandise and spin-offs ===\n\nMerchandise for The Dark Knight includes statuettes, action figures, radio-controlled Tumbler and Batpod models, costumes, sets of Batarangs, a limited-edition Grappling Launcher replica, board games, puzzles, clothing, and a special-edition UNO card game. A novelization written by Dennis O'Neil was released in 2008.\nA direct-to-DVD animated film, Batman: Gotham Knight, was released in July 2008. Executive produced by Bruce Timm and Nolan's wife Emma Thomas, with Goyer as one of the writers, it includes veteran Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy reprising his role. Originally there was interest in bringing Bale and other actors from the live-action films to voice their respective characters, but it was not possible due to scheduling conflicts. Gotham Knight presents six vignettes, each of which are animated in a different artistic style, set between the events of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.\nA video game adaptation, Batman: The Dark Knight, was canceled due to development problems. The Dark Knight Coaster, an indoor roller coaster, opened in May 2008 at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Costing $7.5 million, the 1,213-foot (370 m) long attraction places riders in an imitation of Wayne Central Station in Gotham City as they move through areas that are vandalized or controlled by the Joker.\n\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\n\n=== Terrorism and escalation ===\nA central theme of The Dark Knight is escalation, particularly the rise of the Joker in response to Batman's vigilantism. Batman's vigilante operation arms him with high-tech military equipment against common criminals, and the Joker is the inevitable response and escalation of lawlessness to counter Batman. Critic Siddhant Adlakha considered the Joker an analog for countries such as Iraq, Somalia, and Lebanon, which were targeted by U.S. military campaigns and responded with escalation using terrorism. Batman also inspires copycat vigilantes, further escalating lawlessness. Film studies professor Todd McGowan said Batman asserts authority over these copycats, telling them to stop because they do not have the same defensive equipment as himself, reaffirming his self-given authority to act as a vigilante.\nThe film has been analyzed as an analog for the war on terror, the militaristic campaign the U.S. launched following the September 11 attacks. The scene in which Batman stands in the ruins of a destroyed building, having failed to prevent the Joker's plot, is reminiscent of the World Trade Center site after September 11. According to historian Stephen Prince, The Dark Knight is about the consequences of civil and government authorities abandoning rules in the fight against terrorism. Several publications criticized The Dark Knight for a perceived endorsement of \"necessary evils\" such as torture and rendition. Author Andrew Klavan said Batman is a stand-in for then-U.S. president George W. Bush and justified the breaching of \"boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that [Batman] will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past\". Klavan's interpretation was criticized by some publications that considered The Dark Knight anti-war, proposing society must not abandon the rule of law to combat lawlessness or risk creating the conditions for escalation. This is exemplified in the covert alliance formed between Batman, Dent, and Gordon, leading to Rachel's death and Dent's corruption. Writer Benjamin Kerstein said both viewpoints are valid, and that \"The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, for the first time in decades, an American mainstream no longer exists\".\nBatman and Dent resort to torture or enhanced interrogation to stop the Joker but he remains immune to their efforts because he has a strong belief in his goals. When Dent ineffectually attempts to torture Joker's henchman, Batman does not condemn the act, only being concerned about public perception if people discover the truth. This conveys the protagonists' gradual abandonment of their principles when faced with an extreme foe. The Joker meets Dent in a hospital to explain how expected atrocities, such as the deaths of several soldiers, and societal failings are tolerated but when norms are unexpectedly disrupted, people panic and descend into chaos. Although the Joker wears disguising makeup, he is not hiding behind a mask and is the same person with or without makeup. He lacks any identity or origin, representing the uncertainty, unknowability, and fear of terrorism, although he does not follow any political ideology. Dent represents the fulfillment of American idealism, a noble person who can work within the confines of the law and allow Batman to retire, but the fear and chaos embodied by the Joker taints that idealism and corrupts Dent absolutely.\nIn The Dark Knight's final act, Batman employs an invasive surveillance network by co-opting the phones of Gotham's citizens to locate the Joker, violating their privacy. Adlakha described this act as a \"militaristic fantasy\", in which a significant violation of civil liberties is required through the means of advanced technology to capture a dangerous terrorist, reminiscent of the 2001 Patriot Act. Lucius Fox threatens to stop helping Batman in response, believing he has crossed an ethical boundary, and although Batman agrees these violations are unacceptable and destroys the technology, the film demonstrates he could not have stopped the Joker in time without it.\n\n\n=== Morality and ethics ===\nThe Dark Knight focuses on the moral and ethical battles faced by the central characters, and the compromises they make to defeat the Joker under extraordinary circumstances. Roger Ebert said the Joker forces impossible ethical decisions on each character to test the limits of their morality. Batman represents order to the Joker's chaos and is brought to his own limit but avoids completely compromising himself. Dent represents goodness and hope; he is the city's \"white knight\" who is \"pure\" of intent and can operate within the law. Dent is motivated to do good because he identifies himself as good, not through trauma like Batman, and has faith in the legal system. Adlakha wrote Dent is framed as a religious icon, his campaign slogan being \"I believe in Harvey Dent\", and his eventual death leaves his arms spread wide like Jesus on the Cross. Eckhart described Dent as someone who loves the law but feels constrained by it and his inability to do what he believes is right because the rules he must follow do not allow it. Dent's desire to work outside the law is seen in his support of Batman's vigilantism to accomplish what he cannot.\nDent's corruption suggests he is a proxy for those looking for hope because he is as fallible and susceptible to darkness as anyone else. This can be seen in his use of a two-headed coin to make decisions involving others, eliminating the risk of chance by controlling the outcome in his favor, indicating losing is not an acceptable outcome for him. Once Dent experiences a significant traumatic event in the loss of Rachel and his own disfigurement, he quickly abandons his noble former self to seek his own form of justice. His coin is scarred on one side, introducing the risk of chance, and he submits himself to it completely. According to English professor Daniel Boscaljon, Dent is not broken; he believes in a different form of justice in a seemingly unjust world, flipping a coin because it is \"Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair.\"\nThe Joker represents an ideological deviancy; he does not seek personal gain and causes chaos for its own sake, setting a towering pile of cash ablaze to prove \"everything burns\". Unlike Batman, the Joker is the same with or without makeup, having no identity to conceal and nothing to lose. Boscaljon wrote the residents and criminals believe in a form of order and rules that must be obeyed; the Joker deliberately upends this belief because he has no rules or limitations. The character can be considered an example of Friedrich Nietzsche's \"Superman\", who exists outside definitions such as good and evil, and follows his own indomitable will. The film, however, leaves open the option to dismiss his insights because his chaos ultimately leads to death and injustice. Christopher described the Joker as an unadulterated evil, and professor Charles Bellinger considered him a satanic figure who repels people from goodness and tempts them with things they supposedly lack, such as forcing Batman to choose between saving Dent\u2014who is best for the city\u2014and Rachel, who is best for Wayne. The Joker aims to corrupt Dent to prove anyone, even symbols, can be broken. In their desperation, Dent and Batman are forced to question their own limitations. As the Joker states to Batman:\n\nTheir morals, their code ... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see\u2014I'll show you ... when the chips are down, these civilized people ... they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster ... I'm just ahead of the curve.\nThe ferry scene can be seen as the Joker's true defeat, demonstrating he is wrong about the residents turning on each other in an extreme scenario. According to writer David Chen, this demonstrates, individually, people cannot responsibly handle power but by sharing the responsibility, there is hope for a compassionate outcome. Although Batman holds to his morals and does not kill the Joker, he is forced to break his code by pushing Dent to his death to save an innocent person. Batman chooses to become a symbol of criminality by taking the blame for Dent's crimes and preserving him as a symbol of good, maintaining the hope of Gotham's residents. Critic David Crow wrote Batman's true test is not defeating the Joker but saving Dent, a task at which he fails. Batman makes his own Christ-like sacrifice, taking on Dent's sins to preserve the city.\nAlthough The Dark Knight presents this as a heroic act, this \"noble lie\" is used to conceal and manipulate the truth for what a minority determines is the greater good. McGowan considered the act heroic because Batman's sacrifice will leave him hunted and despised without recognition, indicating he has learned from the Joker the established norms must sometimes be broken. According to professor Martin Fradley, among others, Batman's \"noble lie\" and Gordon's support of it is a cynical endorsement of deception and totalitarianism. Wayne's butler Alfred also commits a noble lie, concealing Rachel's choice of Dent over Wayne to spare him the pain of her rejection.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Cultural influence ===\nThe Dark Knight is considered an influential and often-imitated work that redefined the superhero/comic-book film genre, and filmmaking in general. In 2020, the United States Library of Congress selected The Dark Knight to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nBefore The Dark Knight, superhero films closely emulated their comic-book source material, and though the genre had seen significant successes such as Superman (1978), Batman (1989), X-Men (2000), and Spider-Man (2002), they were often considered disposable entertainment that did not garner much industry respect. A 2018 retrospective by The Hollywood Reporter said The Dark Knight taught filmmakers \"comic book characters are malleable. They are able to be grounded or fantastic, able to be prestigious or pure blockbuster entertainment, to be dark and gritty or light, to be character-driven or action-packed, or any variation in-between.\"\nThe Dark Knight is considered a blueprint for the modern superhero film that productions either attempt to closely emulate or deliberately counter. Its financial, critical, and cultural successes legitimized the genre with film studios at a time when recent films, such as Daredevil, Hulk (both 2003), Fantastic Four (2005), and Superman Returns (2006) had failed to meet expectations. The genre became a focus of annual studio strategies rather than a relatively niche project, and a surge of comic-book adaptations followed, in part because of their broad franchising potential. In 2008, Ebert wrote; \"[The Dark Knight], and to a lesser degree Iron Man, redefine the possibilities of the 'comic-book movie'\". The Atlantic wrote Iron Man's legacy in launching the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) could not have happened without the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight, which made comic book adaptations a central focus of film studios.\nRetrospective analysis has focused on the way studios, eager to replicate its performance, released tonally dark, gritty, and realistic films, or reboots of existing franchises, many of which failed critically or commercially. Some publications said studios took the wrong lessons from The Dark Knight, treating source material too seriously and mistaking a dark, gritty tone for narrative depth and intelligent writing. The MCU is seen as a successful continuation of what made The Dark Knight a success, combining genres and tones relevant to each respective film while treating the source material seriously, unlike the DC Extended Universe, which more closely emulated the tone of The Dark Knight but failed to replicate its success.\nDirectors including Sam Mendes (Skyfall, 2012), Ryan Coogler (Black Panther), and David Ayer (Suicide Squad, 2016), have cited it as an influence on their work, Steven Spielberg listed it among his favorite films, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet said it inspired him to become an actor. The film has been referenced in a variety of media including television shows such as Robot Chicken, South Park, and The Simpsons. U.S. President Barack Obama used Joker to explain the growth of Islamic State (IS) military group, saying \" ... the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting ... they were thugs, but there was a kind of order ... the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. [IS] is the Joker.\" Joker's appearance became a popular Halloween costume and also influenced the 2009 Barack Obama \"Joker\" poster.\n\n\n=== Retrospective assessments ===\nSince its release, The Dark Knight has been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever made, among the greatest films ever made, and one of the best sequel films. It is also considered among the best films of the 2000s, and in a 2010 poll of thirty-seven critics by Metacritic regarding the decade's top films, The Dark Knight received the eighth most mentions, appearing on 7 lists. In the 2010s, a poll of 177 film critics by the BBC in 2016 listed it as the 33rd-best film of the 21st century, and The Guardian placed it 98th on its own list. In 2020, Empire magazine named it third-best, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). As of 2023, it remains the highest critically rated Batman film according to Rotten Tomatoes, and is often ranked as the best film featuring the character.\nThe Dark Knight remains popular with entertainment industry professionals, including directors, actors, critics, and stunt actors, being ranked 57th on The Hollywood Reporter's poll of the best films ever made, 18th on Time Out's list of the best action films, and 96th on the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest American Films. The Dark Knight is included in the film-reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and film critics James Berardinelli and Barry Norman included it in their individual listings of the 100 greatest films of all time. In 2012, Total Film named it the sixth-most-accomplished film of the preceding fifteen years, and a 2020 article by Empire named The Dark Knight as one of the films that defined the previous three decades. In 2020, Time Out named it the seventy-second-best action movie ever made.\nLedger's Joker is considered one of the greatest cinematic villains; several publications placed his portrayal second only to Darth Vader. In 2017, The Hollywood Reporter named Ledger's Joker the second-best cinematic superhero performance ever, behind Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and Collider listed him as the greatest villain of the 21st century. In 2022, Variety listed him as the best superhero film performance of the preceding 50 years (Eckhart appears at number 22). Entertainment Weekly wrote there had not been another villain as interesting or \"perversely entertaining\" as Joker, and Ledger's performance was considered so defining that future interpretations would be compared against it. Michael B. Jordan cited the character as an inspiration for his character Erik Killmonger in Black Panther. The \"pencil trick\" scene, in which Joker makes a pencil disappear by slamming a mobster's head on it, is considered an iconic scene and among the film's most famous. Similarly, the character's line \"why so serious?\" is among the film's most famous and oft-quoted pieces of dialog, alongside \"everyone loses their minds,\" and Dent's line \"you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\", as well as Pennyworth's line \"some men just want to watch the world burn\"; the lines also became popular internet memes.\nThe Dark Knight remains popular with audiences in publicly voted rankings. Over 17,000 people voted the film into the top ten of American Cinematographer's \"Best-Shot Film of 1998\u20132008\" list, and listeners of BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra named it their eighth-favorite film. Readers of Empire have alternatively voted it the fifteenth (2008), third (2014), and the fourth-greatest film ever made (2020). The Dark Knight was also voted the greatest superhero movie by readers of Rolling Stone (2014), and as one of New Zealand's favorite films (2015).\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nThe Dark Knight was followed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012), the conclusion of The Dark Knight Trilogy. In the film, Batman is forced out of his self-imposed retirement following the events of The Dark Knight; he allies with Selina Kyle / Catwoman to take on Bane, a physically imposing revolutionary allied with the League of Shadows that is featured in Batman Begins. The Dark Knight Rises was a financial success, surpassing the box-office take of The Dark Knight, and was generally well received by critics but proved more divisive with audiences.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\nBoscaljon, Daniel (2013). \"The Flip Side Of Justice: The Two-faced Spirit Of The Dark Knight\".

            "Joker is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he co-wrote with Scott Silver. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix and is loosely based on DC Comics characters, including the Joker. It follows Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and aspiring stand-up comedian whose descent into mental illness and nihilism culminates with the emergence of an alter-ego known as \"Joker\" and inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, and Frances Conroy appear in supporting roles. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, Joker was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and DC Films in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative and Joint Effort.\nPhillips conceived Joker in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese, particularly Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1982); Scorsese was initially attached to the project as a producer. The film loosely adapts plot elements from Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) and The Dark Knight Returns (1986), but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration, nor did he wish for it to be connected to any prior Batman film continuity. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. Principal photography took place in New York City, Jersey City and Newark, from September to December 2018. Joker is the first live-action theatrical Batman film to receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association.\nJoker premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it won the Golden Lion, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 4. The film was a box office success and set records for an October release. It grossed over $1 billion, becoming the first R-rated film to do so, and it was the highest-grossing R-rated film until being surpassed by Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024. It was also the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019. The film received numerous accolades, including two Academy Award wins at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score out of 11 nominations including Best Picture, becoming the first DC film to do so. A sequel, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was released on October 4, 2024.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nArthur Fleck is a professional clown and aspiring stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Penny, in the crime-and recession-ridden city of  Gotham, New York. He suffers from a neurological disorder that causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication for which he depends on social services to obtain. One day, after Arthur is attacked by street youths while on the job, his co-worker Randall gives him a revolver for self-defense. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club.\nArthur drops the gun on the floor while performing at a children's hospital, leading to his firing. While riding home on the subway and still wearing his clown make-up, he is mocked and assaulted by three drunk businessmen from Wayne Investments. He fatally shoots two of them in self-defense and murders the third as he attempts to flee. Their employer, billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, condemns the killings but protesters begin sporting clown masks in Arthur's image. Budget cuts shut down the social services program, leaving Arthur without his medication.\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which fails due to his disorder and his jokes falling flat. Arthur intercepts a letter from Penny to Thomas, revealing that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth of his parentage. He goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets Thomas's young son Bruce, but flees after a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized. Arthur's idol, popular late-night talk show host Murray Franklin, presents clips of Arthur's failed performance on his show and mockingly calls him a \"joker\".\nArthur confronts Thomas at a movie theatre. Thomas denies being his father, claiming that Penny is not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and reads Penny's file, which states she was a delusional narcissist who adopted Arthur while working as a housekeeper for the Waynes. She developed an imaginary intimate relationship with Thomas, which included Arthur being their biological son. At the same time, Penny raised Arthur with an abusive boyfriend who physically and sexually abused him, which Penny ignored, leading to his neurological disorder. A distraught Arthur enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, she kindly asks him to leave, revealing their relationship to be a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\nArthur is soon invited to be on Murray's show. He subsequently plans to kill himself with his revolver during the broadcast. While crafting a clown-inspired persona, he is visited by Randall and another ex-colleague, Gary. Arthur fatally stabs Randall, but spares Gary for being kind to him in the past. Two detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the subway murders pursue him onto a train filled with clown protesters. Arthur incites a brawl, during which one detective accidentally shoots and kills a protester. The other protesters, in turn, beat the detectives while Arthur escapes.\nAt the studio, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as \"Joker\", a reference to his earlier mockery. As the show goes live, Arthur tells morbid jokes, confesses to the subway murders, rants about societal neglect on the downtrodden, and berates Murray for ridiculing him. After a final joke, Arthur shoots and kills Murray during the broadcast. Arthur is arrested, and riots erupt across the city. Looters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him. Meanwhile, one rioter corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife Martha, sparing Bruce. Arthur stands atop the police car, dances to the cheers of the crowd, and smears blood on his face into the shape of a smile.\nAt Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke during a session with his new therapist. He declines telling it to her, affirming she would not understand it. After the session, he leaves behind a trail of bloodied shoeprints as an orderly chases him down.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck / Joker: A mentally ill, impoverished party clown and stand-up comedian disregarded by society, whose history of abuse causes him to become a nihilistic criminal with a clown-inspired persona. Phoenix had been interested in a low-budget \"character study\" of a comic book character and said the film \"feels unique, it is its own world in some ways and maybe [...] It might as well be the thing that scares you the most\". Phoenix lost 52 pounds (23 kg) for his role in the film.\nRobert De Niro as Murray Franklin: A talk show host who plays a role in Arthur's downfall. De Niro said his role in Joker pays homage to his character from The King of Comedy (1982), Rupert Pupkin, who is a comedian obsessed with a talk-show host.\nZazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond: A cynical single mother and Arthur's \"love interest\". Beetz, a huge fan of Phoenix, said that it was an honor to costar with him and that she learned a lot working with him on set.\nFrances Conroy as Penny Fleck: Arthur's mentally and physically ill mother, who formerly worked for Thomas Wayne.\nHannah Gross as young Penny.\nAdditionally, Brett Cullen portrays Thomas Wayne, a billionaire running for mayor of Gotham. Alec Baldwin was initially cast in the role, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Carrie Louise Putrello portrays Thomas's wife Martha, although the character has no dialogue (she only screams) and is never referred to by name. Douglas Hodge plays Alfred Pennyworth, the butler and caretaker of the Wayne family, and Dante Pereira-Olson plays Bruce Wayne, Thomas' son.\nAdditional cast members include Glenn Fleshler and Leigh Gill as Randall and Gary, Arthur's clown co-workers; Bill Camp and Shea Whigham as detectives Garrity and Burke in the Gotham City Police Department; Marc Maron as Gene Ufland, a producer on Franklin's show; Sharon Washington as Arthur's social worker, Debra Kane; Josh Pais as Hoyt Vaughn, Arthur's boss; Brian Tyree Henry as Clark, a clerk at Arkham State Hospital; Frank Wood as Dr. Benjamin Stoner, Penny Fleck's former therapist; Ben Warheit, Michael Benz and Carl Lundstedt as the three Wayne Investments employees who harass Arthur on the subway; Gary Gulman and Sam Morril as comedians at an open mic where Arthur performs; and Bryan Callen as Javier, a co-worker of Arthur. Justin Theroux has an uncredited cameo as Ethan Chase, a celebrity guest on Franklin's show.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, Joaquin Phoenix expressed interest to his agent in acting in a low-budget \"character study\" type of film about a comic book villain, like DC Comics character the Joker, before Phillips pitched Joker in 2016. Phoenix had previously declined to act in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) because he would have been required to reprise a role, such as Bruce Banner / Hulk (initially portrayed by Edward Norton before he was recast by Mark Ruffalo) or Stephen Strange / Doctor Strange (ultimately portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch), in multiple films. Phoenix ruled out the Joker for his \"character study\" idea and tried to think of a different one. \"I thought, 'You can't do the Joker, because, you know, it's just you can't do that character, it's just been done'\". Phoenix's agent suggested setting up an exploratory meeting with Warner Bros., but he declined and let go of the idea. Similarly, Todd Phillips had been offered to direct comic-based films a number of times, but declined because he thought they were \"loud\" and did not interest him. According to Phillips, Joker spawned from his idea to create a different, more grounded comic book film. He was attracted to the Joker because he did not think there was a definitive portrayal of the character, which he knew would provide considerable creative freedom.\nPhillips pitched the idea for Joker to Warner Bros. after his film War Dogs premiered in August 2016. Prior to War Dogs, Phillips was mostly known for his comedy films, such as Road Trip (2000), Old School (2003) and The Hangover (2009); War Dogs marked a venture into more unsettling territory. During the premiere, Phillips realized \"War Dogs wasn't going to set the world on fire and I was thinking, 'What do people really want to see?'\" In addition, he found that it was difficult to make comedy films in the \"woke culture\", throughout opposition of \"30 million people on Twitter\". He finally thought that \"How do I do something irreverent, but fuck comedy? Oh I know, let's take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this\". He proposed that DC Films differentiate its slate from the competing Marvel Studios' by producing low-budget, standalone films. After the successful release of Wonder Woman (2017), DC Films decided to deemphasize the shared nature of its DC-based film franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). In August 2017, Warner Bros. and DC Films revealed plans for the film, with Phillips directing and co-writing with Scott Silver and Martin Scorsese set to co-produce with Phillips. According to Tatiana Siegel of The Hollywood Reporter, Scorsese considered directing Joker before Phillips was chosen, though a Warner Bros. source said he only became involved because the film needed a New York City-based producer.\nAccording to Kim Masters and Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter, Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in the DCEU, was displeased by the existence of a project separate from his interpretation. In October 2019, Masters reported that Leto \"felt 'alienated and upset'\" when he learned that Warner Bros.\u2014which had promised him a standalone DCEU Joker film\u2014let Phillips proceed with Joker, going as far as to ask his music manager Irving Azoff to get the project canceled. Masters added that Leto's irritation was what caused him to end his association with Creative Artists Agency (CAA), as he believed \"his agents should have told him about the Phillips project earlier and fought harder for his version of Joker\". However, sources associated with Leto deny that he attempted to get Joker canceled and left CAA because of it.\nWarner Bros. pushed for Phillips to cast Leonardo DiCaprio as the Joker, hoping to use his frequent collaborator Scorsese's involvement to attract him. However, Phillips said that Phoenix was the only actor he considered, and that he and Silver wrote the script with Phoenix in mind, \"The goal was never to introduce Joaquin Phoenix into the comic book movie universe. The goal was to introduce comic book movies into the Joaquin Phoenix universe\". Phoenix said when he learned of the film, he became excited because it was the kind he was looking to make, describing it as unique and stating it did not feel like a typical \"studio movie\". It took him some time to commit to the role, as it intimidated him and he said \"oftentimes, in these movies, we have these simplified, reductive archetypes and that allows for the audience to be distant from the character, just like we would do in real life, where it's easy to label somebody as evil and therefore say, 'Well, I'm not that.'\"\n\n\n=== Writing ===\n\nPhillips and Silver wrote Joker throughout 2017 and the writing process took about a year. According to producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff, it took some time to get approval for the script from Warner Bros., partly because of concerns over the content. Similarly, Phillips commented that there were \"a zillion hurdles\" during the year-long writing process due to the visibility of the character. Phillips said that while the script's themes may reflect modern society, the film was not intended to be political. He also noted that Joker is a story about child trauma and mental illness. In their script, Phillips talked about how difficult it is for patients to reveal their diagnoses, referring to a line from the film: \"The worst part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don't\".\nThe script draws inspiration from Scorsese films such as Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980) and The King of Comedy (1982), as well as Phillips' Hangover Trilogy. Other films Phillips has cited as inspiration include character studies released in the 1970s\u2014such as Serpico (1973) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\u2014the silent film The Man Who Laughs (1928) and several musicals. Phillips said that aside from the tone, he did not consider Joker that different from his previous work, such as his Hangover films. The film's premise was inspired by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), which depicts the Joker as a failed stand-up comedian, while the climactic talk show scene was inspired by a similar scene in Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns (1986). However, Phillips said the film does not \"follow anything from the comic books... That's what was interesting to me. We're not even doing Joker, but the story of becoming Joker\". Phillips later clarified that he meant they did not look to a specific comic for inspiration, but rather \"picked and chose what we liked\" from the character's history. Having grown up in New York, Phillips also drew inspiration from life in New York City during the early 1980s. The Subway shooting scene and its aftermath were inspired by the 1984 New York City Subway shooting, while Arthur Fleck is partially based on the shooting's perpetrator, Bernhard Goetz.\nPhillips and Silver found the most common Joker origin story, in which the character is disfigured after falling into a vat of acid, too unrealistic. Instead, they used certain elements of the Joker lore to produce an original story, which Phillips wanted to feel as authentic as possible. Because the Joker does not have a definitive origin story in the comics, Phillips and Silver were given considerable creative freedom and \"pushed each other every day to come up with something totally insane\". While the Joker had appeared in several films before, Phillips thought it was possible to produce a new story featuring the character. \"It's just another interpretation, like people do interpretations of Macbeth\", he told The New York Times.  However, they did try to retain the ambiguous \"multiple choice\" nature of the Joker's past by positioning the character as an unreliable narrator\u2014with entire storylines simply being his delusions\u2014and left what mental illnesses he suffers from unclear. As such, Phillips said the entire film is open to interpretation.\nWhen a draft of the film's script, written in April 2018, was leaked and spread on the internet, Phillips stated that it was an old version from six months before filming began. Phillips also declined to take legal action against the spread of the script, stating that he liked having an old version circulate.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n\nFollowing the disappointing critical and financial performance of Justice League (2017), in January 2018 Walter Hamada replaced Jon Berg as the head of DC-based film production at Warner Bros. Hamada sorted through the various DC films in development, canceling some while advancing work on others; the film was set to begin filming in late 2018 with a small budget of $55 million. Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter said Warner Bros. was reluctant to let Joker move forward and gave it a small budget in an effort to dissuade Phillips. Phillips said that Hamada did not understand what he was trying to do. By June, Robert De Niro was under consideration for a supporting role in the film. The deal with Phoenix was finalized in July 2018, after four months of persuasion from Phillips. Immediately afterwards, Warner Bros. officially green-lit the film, titled it Joker and gave it an October 4, 2019, release date. Warner Bros. described the film as \"an exploration of a man disregarded by society [that] is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale\".\nScorsese's longtime associate Koskoff joined to produce, although Scorsese left his producing duties due to other obligations. Scorsese considered serving as an executive producer, but was preoccupied with his film The Irishman (2019). It was also confirmed that the film would have no effect on Leto's Joker and would be the first in a new series of DC films unrelated to the DCEU. In July, Zazie Beetz was cast in a supporting role and De Niro entered negotiations in August. Frances McDormand declined an offer to portray the mother of the Joker and Frances Conroy was cast. At the end of July, Marc Maron and Bryan Callen joined the cast. Alec Baldwin was cast as Thomas Wayne on August 27, but dropped out two days later due to scheduling conflicts. Baldwin also noted the character's description as a reason for his departure, which called Thomas Wayne \"a cheesy and tanned businessman who is more in the mold of a 1980s Donald Trump\".\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in September 2018 in New York City, under the working title Romeo. Shortly after filming began, De Niro, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Josh Pais and Douglas Hodge were announced to have joined the film, with Cullen replacing Baldwin. Bradley Cooper joined the film as a producer, and the director of photography was Lawrence Sher, both of whom Phillips had previously collaborated with. On September 22, a scene depicting a violent protest was filmed at the Church Avenue station in Kensington, Brooklyn, although the station was modified to look like the Bedford Park Boulevard station in the Bronx. Filming of violent scenes also took place at the abandoned lower platform of the Ninth Avenue station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.\nAccording to Beetz, Phillips rewrote the entire script during production; because Phoenix lost so much weight for the film, there would not be an opportunity for reshoots. She recalled, \"we would go into Todd's trailer and write the scene for the night and then do it. During hair and makeup we'd memorize those lines and then do them and then we'd reshoot that three weeks later\". Phillips recalled Phoenix sometimes walked off-set during filming because he lost self-control and needed to compose himself\u2014to the confusion of other actors, who felt they had done something wrong. De Niro was one of the few Phoenix never walked out on and De Niro said he was \"very intense in what he was doing, as it should be, as he should be\".\nFilming in Jersey City started on September 30 and shut down Newark Avenue, while filming in November, starting on November 9, shut down Kennedy Boulevard. Filming in Newark began on October 13 and lasted until October 16. Shortly before the Newark filming, SAG-AFTRA received a complaint that extras were locked in subway cars for more than three hours during filming in Brooklyn, a break violation. The issue was quickly resolved after a representative visited the set. That month, Dante Pereira-Olson joined the cast as a young Bruce Wayne. Whigham said towards the end of October the film was in \"the middle\" of production, adding that it was an \"intense\" and \"incredible\" experience. By mid-November, filming had moved back to New York. Filming wrapped on December 3, 2018, with Phillips posting a picture on his Instagram feed later in the month to commemorate the occasion.\nIn The Hollywood Reporter interview, Emma Tillinger Koskoff said that most stressful filming was the \"Stair Dance\" scene; because there were no laws on paparazzi in New York City, filming was disrupted by them. The South Bronx stairs used for the biographical crime film American Gangster (2007) were originally to be used for these scenes, according to The New York Times, but were deemed too repaved and beautified to be aesthetically acceptable for the film's tone. Initially, Lawrence Sher and Phillips had wanted to film on 65mm film for the 70mm format, but Warner Bros. rejected this due to cost, and the film was subsequently shot with Arri Alexa 65 digital cameras. Warner Bros. did however end up giving Joker a limited theatrical release in converted 70mm and 35mm presentations.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nPhillips confirmed he was in the process of editing Joker in March 2019. At CinemaCon the following month, he stated the film was \"still taking shape\" and was difficult to discuss, as he hoped to maintain secrecy. Phillips also denied most reports surrounding the film, which he felt was because it is \"an origin story about a character that doesn't have a definitive origin\". Brian Tyree Henry was also confirmed to have a role in the film. The visual effects were provided by Scanline VFX and Shade VFX and supervised by Matthew Giampa and Bryan Godwin, with Erwin Rivera serving as the overall supervisor. Joker used less VFX work than other comics films, except few scenes including that Arthur smeared smile by his blood in crowd.\nOne scene that was cut from the film depicted Sophie watching Arthur's appearance on Franklin's show. The scene was intended to show the audience that she is still alive (as the film otherwise implies that Arthur kills her), but Phillips decided it would disrupt the narrative, which is portrayed from Arthur's point of view. In another deleted scene, Arthur reveals his crimes to a co-worker; the scene was ultimately removed because it provided \"too much information\" in the form of exposition. According to one source, the film's original script ended with Arthur carving himself a Glasgow smile in front of his crowd of supporters, but the idea got shot down by then Warner Bros. executive Christopher Nolan, who mandated that only Heath Ledger's version of the Joker from his film The Dark Knight (2008) should have a Glasgow smile.\nThe film's final budget was $55\u201370 million, considered by The Hollywood Reporter \"a fraction\" of the cost of a typical comic book-based film. In comparison, the previous villain-centered DC film, Suicide Squad (2016), cost $175 million. $25 million of Joker's budget was covered by the Toronto-based financing company Creative Wealth Media, while Village Roadshow Pictures and Bron Studios each contributed 25%. Joker was also the first live-action theatrical film in the Batman film franchise to receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, officially for \"strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images\". In the United Kingdom, the BBFC gave the film a 15 certificate for \"strong bloody violence [and] language\".\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Set ===\nGotham City in Joker was set in 1980s New York City, according to Todd Phillips, \"to separate it, quite frankly, from the DC universe\". Mark Friedberg, the production designer of this film, said he established the filming location of Gotham Square in Newark as a film set because there was still poverty. He wanted Gotham to look like a gritty city, as described in Taxi Driver (1976), so he named all structures and lines in this film and drew a specific map of Gotham city. He displayed 1970s brightly colored muscle cars on the set, \"conveying dissonance and being awful and beautiful at the same time\". He also tried to describe Gotham as a decaying city through graffiti, garbage on the road and cracked sidewalks. The VFX team added fictional buildings, changing the skyline of the city to give the sense that the city was pressing down on Arthur. Lawrence Sher said sodium-vapor lights were used in this film, representing Arthur's isolation and his more hopeful side.\n\nArkham State Hospital is based on Arkham Asylum. Warner Bros. Korea explained that it is a more realistic name in the real world. The exterior of Arkham State hospital was filmed at Brooklyn Army Terminal, while the interior was pictured in Metropolitan Hospital Center of Harlem. Throughout the film, two walls are shown inside Arkham State Hospital; one is clearly white in the first and last scenes, the other is dirty yellow in the scene in which Arthur runs with a medical report. This difference was intended to make the audience confused and to question the possibility that Arthur had been in hospital the entire time.\n\n\n=== Character design ===\nOne of the most important inspirations for Arthur's behavior came from the Little Tramp in Modern Times (1936), while his \"ridiculous\" movement was inspired by Charlie Chaplin. Arthur's dance was influenced by that of Ray Bolger, and his gesture of making a smile from two fingers was from the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz (1939). In preparation, Phoenix ate a single sparse meal per day for 8 months, losing 52 pounds (24 kg) to look \"wolf-like and malnourished and hungry\", and watched videos of people suffering from pathological laughter to refine his own laughter for the role. He sought to portray a character whom audiences could not relate to and did not look to previous Joker actors for inspiration; instead, he read a book about political assassinations so he could understand killers and their motivations. Phillips identified Arthur's normal face as being his \"real mask\", while Joker served as his true personality. He had also identified the genuine laugh occurring only in the last scene. Director Todd Phillips said that he intentionally left it ambiguous as to whether Arthur becomes the Joker of traditional Batman stories or inspires a separate character, although Phoenix believes that Arthur is the former.\n\n\n=== Make-up and costumes ===\nNicki Ledermann and Kay Georgiou, the makeup designer and hairstylist tried to show Arthur Fleck to \"be handmade and realistic\". Georgiou designated Arthur as a man with unwashed hair. Arthur's costumes, designed by Mark Bridges, were matched to look \"aged, overdyed and distressed\" through wearing him with cheap polyester pants and an acrylic sweater. His color palette was inspired by the aesthetics of the 1980s: blue, maroon, brown, mauve and gray. Bridges explained Arthur's costume color started from a \"juvenile mode\" and later changing to align with the tone of the film. In the first scene, Arthur's \"too small\" hooded jacket and white socks emphasizes the childish concept, being a reflection of him living with his mother Penny, with her calling him \"my little boy\", and the influence of Charlie Chaplin. However, he wore a charcoal sweater during the scene in which he is interviewed by the social worker and finally wore a \"scab-colored knit top\" in Arkham State Hospital. A line depicting his old suit for many years was interpreted a mustard-toned vest and a patterned bottle-green shirt.\nAfter turning Arthur into Joker, his design was also changed. His hair was dyed \"broccoli\" green and he wore a suit similar to the one in the original Batman series. However, the Joker suit in this film had different colors compared to previous films (purple suit with a green or yellow shirt). Mark Bridges noted that it was result of Phillips' intention to not want to be \"connected to anything else\". Initially, the color of the suit in the script was set to terracotta, but Bridges changed this to red to give \"more expressive\" emotion. Additionally, his suit colors (green, yellow, purple and red) were contrasted with those of his antagonists, including Thomas Wayne, giving them to gray and blue like Batman. Clown makeup was drawn with a classic, antique feel, with darker colors and tones and menacing eyebrows. Due to copyright laws stating that no two clowns can look alike, Ledermann faced a challenge.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nIn August 2018, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir was hired to compose the film's score. Hildur began writing music after reading the script and meeting with Phillips, who \"had a lot of strong ideas\" about how he thought the score should sound. She worked on the Joker score alongside the score for the drama miniseries Chernobyl; Hildur told The Hindu's Divya-Kala Bhavani switching between the two was challenging because the scores were so different.\nAdditionally, the film features the songs \"That's Life\", \"Send In the Clowns\", \"White Room\" and \"Rock and Roll Part 2\". The use of \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" generated controversy when it was reported that its singer, convicted child sex offender Gary Glitter, would receive royalties, but it was later confirmed he would not since he had long since sold the rights. The score was released on October 2, 2019, by WaterTower Music. Hildur's music won numerous awards including an Academy Award, a Satellite Award, a Saturn Award, the Hollywood Music in Media Awards (HMMA) and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, with the latter making her the first woman to win as a solo composer in that category.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nPhillips promoted Joker by posting on set photos on his Instagram account. On September 21, 2018, he released test footage of Phoenix in-costume as the Joker, with \"Laughing\" by The Guess Who accompanying the footage. At CinemaCon on April 2, 2019, Phillips unveiled the first trailer for the film, which was released online the following day. The trailer, prominently featuring the song \"Smile\" performed by Jimmy Durante, generated positive responses, with some commentators comparing it to Taxi Driver and Requiem for a Dream (2000) and praising Phoenix's performance. Writers described the trailer as dark and gritty, with ComicBook.com's Jenna Anderson feeling it appeared more like a psychological thriller than a comic book film. Actor Mark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker since the cartoon Batman: The Animated Series (1992\u20131995), expressed enthusiasm on Twitter. Conversely, io9's Germain Lussier said the trailer revealed too little and that it was too similar to photos Phillips had posted on Instagram. While he still believed it exhibited potential, Lussier overall thought the trailer was not \"a home run\". The trailer received over eight million views in the first few hours of release.\nOn August 25, 2019, Phillips released six brief teasers that contained flashes of writing, revealing the second trailer would be released on August 28. Filmmaker Kevin Smith commended the trailer, stating he thought the film \"would still work even if [DC Comics] didn't exist\" and praising its uniqueness. Overall, Deadline Hollywood estimated that Warner Bros. spent $120 million on promotion and advertisements.\nAfter release in theaters, Warner Bros. used negative critics on this film for promotion.\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\n\nJoker had its world premiere at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it received an eight-minute standing ovation and won the Golden Lion award. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2019. The film was released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures on October 4, 2019, in the United States and a day earlier in Australia and several other international markets. On November 16, 2019, it was screened at the White House for President Donald Trump, who reportedly enjoyed the film. Some theaters released this movie on 70mm film, by original intention of the movie's director. Following its nominations at various awards shows, the film was scheduled to be rereleased in theaters across North America, beginning on January 17, 2020.\n\n\n==== Security concerns ====\nOn September 18, 2019, the United States Army distributed an email warning service members of potential violence at theaters screening the film and noting the Joker character's popularity among the incel community. A separate memo revealed the Army received \"credible\" information from Texas law enforcement \"regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the release\". The film, forbidden to minors under 17 in the US, was feared to possibly encourage imitations of the criminal behaviors represented in the film in ordinary life. However, according to Deadline Hollywood, the FBI and the United States Department of Homeland Security found no credible threats surrounding the release of the film.\nIn an interview with TheWrap, Phillips expressed surprise at criticism of the film's dark tone, stating \"it's because outrage is a commodity\" and calling critics of the film \"far left\". Phoenix walked out of an interview by The Telegraph when asked if the film could inspire mass shooters. He later returned to finish the interview, but did not answer the question. Following this, journalists were disinvited from the premiere at TCL Chinese Theatre, with only photographers being allowed to interact with the filmmakers and cast on the carpet. In a statement to Variety, Warner Bros. said that \"A lot has been said about Joker and we just feel it's time for people to see the film\".\nThe film did not play at the Aurora, Colorado movie theater where the 2012 mass shooting occurred during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises (2012). Three families of victims, as well as the mother of a witness, signed a letter to Warner Bros. with the request. Additionally, Landmark Theaters prohibited moviegoers from wearing Joker costumes during its run, while the Los Angeles and New York City Police Departments increased police visibility at area theaters, though they did not receive \"any specific threat\".\nUltimately, despite the aforementioned concerns, screenings of the film proceeded and concluded with no reports of violent incidents.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nJoker was released on Digital HD on December 17, 2019, and on DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray on January 7, 2020. It debuted on HBO on May 16, 2020, and on HBO Max when it launched on May 27, 2020.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nJoker grossed $335.5 million in the United States and Canada and $743.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.079 billion. It is the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and the second highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, as well as the first and only R-rated film to pass the billion-dollar mark until Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024. In terms of budget-to-gross ratio, Joker is also the most profitable film based on a comic book, due to its small budget and little decline in week-to-week grosses during its theatrical run, surpassing the record previously held by Deadpool (2016). Deadline Hollywood estimated the film made a net profit of $437 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.\nIn August 2019, BoxOffice magazine analyst Shawn Robbins wrote that he expected Joker to gross $60\u201390 million during its opening weekend in North America. Following the film's premiere, BoxOffice predicted Joker could open to $70\u201395 million domestically. Later updating to $85\u2013105 million, Robbins suggested it could become the first October release to open to over $100 million and surpass the record set by Venom (2018). However, Comscore's senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian thought the film would open closer to $50 million because it is not a \"typical comic-book movie\". Three weeks prior to its release, official industry tracking projected the film would debut to $65\u201380 million, with some estimates going as high as $90 million. The week of its release, Atom Tickets announced pre-sale totals for the film were outpacing those of Venom and It Chapter Two ($91.1 million debut) and that Joker was its second-best-selling R-rated film of 2019 behind John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum.\nJoker opened in 4,374 theaters in North America and made $39.9 million on its first day of release, including $13.3 million from Thursday night previews, besting Venom's respective October records. The film also had the biggest October opening day of any film, beating out Halloween (2018).\nIt went on to break Venom's record for having the biggest October opening weekend, finishing with a domestic total of $96.2 million. The film set career records for Phoenix, Phillips and De Niro and was the fourth-largest debut for an R-rated film of all time. The latter record would cross over The Matrix Reloaded (2003), staying behind Deadpool, Deadpool 2 (2018) and It (2017). It was also Warner Bros.' biggest domestic opening in two years. In its second weekend, the film fell just 41.8% to $55.9 million, remaining in first and marking the best second-weekend October total (besting Gravity (2013)'s $43.1 million in 2013). It made $29.2 million in its third weekend and $19.2 million in its fourth, finishing second behind Maleficent: Mistress of Evil both times. After 155 days, Joker's American theatrical run wrapped up on March 5, 2020, with a final gross of $355.5 million, making it the fourth-highest domestic gross for an R-rated film, behind The Passion of the Christ (2004), Deadpool and American Sniper (2014).\nWorldwide, the film was projected to debut to around $155 million, including $75 million from 73 overseas territories. It made $5.4 million from four countries on its first day and $18.7 million from 47 in its second, for a two-day total of $24.6 million. It went on to greatly exceed expectations, making $140.5 million from overseas territories and a total $234 million worldwide. Its largest markets were South Korea (a Warner Bros. record $16.3 million), the United Kingdom ($14.8 million), Mexico ($13.1 million) and Japan ($7 million). With this, it became the biggest worldwide opening for an October film. During its second weekend, the film made an additional $125.7 million worldwide, and $77.9 million in its third. By this point, industry analysts expected Joker to become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, with some suggesting that it could finish its run with over $1 billion. The film became the highest-grossing R-rated film in its fourth weekend, during which it grossed $47.8 million internationally, and passed the billion-dollar mark about a month into its theatrical release.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Joker holds an approval rating of 68% based on 603 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Joker gives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star \u2013 and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 60 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an overall positive score of 84% (with an average 4 out of 5 stars) and a 60% \"definite recommend\". The critical response to Joker made it one of the worst-reviewed films to ever be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.\nMark Kermode of The Observer rated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating \"Joker has an ace card in the form of Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerisingly physical portrayal of a man who would be king\". Writing for IGN, Jim Vejvoda gave Joker a perfect score, saying that the film \"would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake\". He found it a powerful and unsettling allegory of contemporary neglect and violence and described Phoenix's performance as the Joker as engrossing and \"Oscar-worthy\". Similarly, Xan Brooks of The Observer\u2014who also gave the film a perfect score\u2014called it \"gloriously daring and explosive\" and appreciated how Phillips used elements from Scorsese films to create an original story. Variety's Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"Phoenix is astonishing as a mentally ill geek who becomes the killer-clown Joker in Todd Phillips' neo-Taxi Driver knockout: the rare comic-book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world\".\nComicBook.com's Brandon Davis acclaimed Joker as a groundbreaking comic book adaptation that he found scarier than most 2019 horror films. Davis compared it favorably to the 2008 Batman film The Dark Knight, praised the cinematography and performances and called it a film that needed to be seen to be believed. Deadline Hollywood's Pete Hammond believes the film redefines the Joker and is \"impossible to shake off\". Hammond also praised the story and performances and summarized the film as \"a bravura piece of filmmaking that speaks to the world we are actually living in today in ways that few movies do\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said he was lost for words in describing Phoenix's performance, calling the film \"gut-wrenching\" and \"simply stupendous\".\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire was more mixed and gave the film a \"C+\". He felt that while \"Joker is the boldest and most exciting superhero movie since The Dark Knight\", it was \"also incendiary, confused and potentially toxic\". Ehrlich thought that the film would make DC fans happy and praised Phoenix's performance, but criticized Phillips' direction and the lack of originality. A critical review came from Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com, who gave the film two stars out of four. Though he praised the performances and thought the story worked, Kenny criticized the social commentary and Phillips' direction, finding the film too derivative and believing its focus was \"less in entertainment than in generating self-importance\". In an analysis of the character Joker, Onmanorama's Sajesh Mohan wrote that the movie was clich\u00e9-ridden, the only original part being Joaquin Phoenix's acting. \"The movie, with great pain and in detail, explains how Arthur Fleck turns into Joker dejected by the way the world treats him. Thanks to Phillips and Silver, Phoenix was able to bring out the king among the Jokers\", the analysis read.\nStephanie Zacharek of Time, in a negative review, labeled Phoenix's performance over-the-top and felt that while Phillips tried to \"[give] us a movie all about the emptiness of our culture ... he's just offering a prime example of it\". She argued the plot was nonexistent, \"dark only in a stupidly adolescent way\" and \"stuffed with phony philosophy\". Meanwhile, NPR's Glen Weldon thought the film lacked innovation and said its sympathetic take on the Joker was \"wildly unconvincing and mundanely uninteresting\". Weldon also described Joker as trying too hard to deviate from the comics and, as a result, coming off as an imitation of films like Taxi Driver. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \"the most disappointing film of the year\". While praising Phoenix's performance and the first act, he criticized the film's political plot developments and overall found it too derivative of various Scorsese films.\n\n\n=== Industry response ===\nJoker generated positive responses from industry figures. DC Comics chief creative officer Jim Lee praised it as \"intense, raw and soulful\" and stated that it had remained true to the character despite deviating from the source material. Actor Mark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker in animation and video games since Batman: The Animated Series, thought the film had \"brilliantly\" reinvented the character and gave it \"[two] thumbs up\". Superman (1978) director Richard Donner called the film \"brilliant\", \"fascinating\", \"really well-written\" and stated that Phoenix's performance was \"genius\". Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore called Joker a \"cinematic masterpiece\" and stated it was a \"danger to society\" if people did not see it. Actor Josh Brolin found the film powerful: \"To appreciate Joker I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is\". Actor Vincent D'Onofrio vocally commended Phoenix's performance in the film on Twitter, stating that he \"deserve[d] recognition for this performance\", while actress Jessica Chastain agreed, replying: \"It's one of the greatest pieces of acting I've ever seen\". Actress and screenwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge also praised the film, stating: \"I think the reason people got so uncomfortable [with the film] is because it feels too true, too raw. I was watching it and thinking to myself, God, if this came out a year into Obama's time in office, I don't think we'd be feeling as worried about it\". Filmmaker David Fincher said of the film's unexpected success, \"Nobody would have thought they had a shot at a giant hit with Joker had The Dark Knight not been as massive as it was. I don't think anyone would have looked at that material and thought, 'Yeah, let's take [Taxi Driver's] Travis Bickle and [The King of Comedy's] Rupert Pupkin and conflate them, then trap him in a betrayal of the mentally ill and trot it out for a billion dollars'\". Actor Brendan Gleeson felt that Phoenix's performance as the Joker was absolutely \"indelible\" and one of the most magnificent achievements in cinema he has ever seen, incidentally being that the reason he opted to join the film's sequel Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux (2024) as Jackie Sullivan. Filmmaker Ridley Scott, who had previously worked with Phoenix in Gladiator (2000), felt \"blown away\" by the film; while he disliked the apparent way it celebrated violence, Scott felt that Phoenix's performance was remarkable enough to make Phoenix an \"amazing asset\" for his film Napoleon (2023) in a \"creative and commercial sense\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nIn September 2019, Joker was awarded the Golden Lion, the festival's highest prize, at the 76th Venice International Film Festival. At the 92nd Academy Awards, the film won the Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score awards. It received overall eleven nominations (including Best Picture) from the ceremony, breaking the record of eight held by The Dark Knight for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip or graphic novel. Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also became the first woman to win an original score Oscar since The Full Monty (1997) in 1998. At the 73rd British Academy Film Awards, the film won Best Actor in a Leading Role (Phoenix), Best Casting and Best Original Music out of a leading eleven nominations including Best Film. The film was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards for the 77th ceremony, winning the awards for Best Original Score and Best Actor (Phoenix). The film was nominated for seven awards at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, winning Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Score and was included in the American Film Institute and Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma's top 10 films of 2019.\nHaving won an award at the 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards for Phoenix's performance, Joker also received nominations from other guilds including the Writers Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America. It won a Best Period and/or Character Make-Up in a Feature-Length Motion Picture award from the Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild.\n\n\n== Themes and analysis ==\n\nJoker deals with the themes of mental illness and its both psychological and sociological effects. While its depiction of the Joker has been described as reminiscent of those who commit mass shootings in the United States as well as members of the incel community, Christina Newland of The Guardian concludes that Fleck is not an incel, but wrote that incels are likely to relate to him. Vejvoda, Hammond and Newland interpreted the film as a cautionary tale\u2014society's disregard of those who are less fortunate will create a person like the Joker. Stephen Kent, writing for the Washington Examiner, described Arthur Fleck as blending shared aspects of mass shooters and interpreted its message as a reminder that society is riddled with men like the Joker. Writing in People's World, Chauncey K. Robinson said the film \"walks a fine line between exploration and validation\" of Joker's character and is \"ultimately an in-your-face examination of a broken system that creates its own monsters.\"\nSome writers have expressed concern that Joker's sympathetic portrayal of a homicidal maniac could inspire real-world violence. Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair found the film was too sympathetic towards \"white men who commit heinous crimes\" and that the sociopolitical ideologies represented in the film are \"evils that are far more easily identifiable\" to people \"who shoot up schools and concerts and churches, who gun down the women and men they covet and envy, who let loose some spirit of anarchic animus upon the world\u2014there's almost a woebegone mythos placed on them in the search for answers.\" Jim Geraghty of National Review wrote he was \"worried that a certain segment of America's angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men will watch Joaquin Phoenix descending into madness and a desire to get back at society by hurting as many people as possible and exclaim, 'finally, somebody understands me!'\" Contrarily, Michael Shindler, reviewing the film in Mere Orthodoxy, while agreeing that Joker depicts a sympathetic wish fulfillment fantasy, contends (drawing on insights from Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan) that it is for precisely that reason that the film will, if anything, preemptively quell real-world violence by rendering \"the Flecks of the world into meek somnambulists\".\nBritish neurocriminologist Adrian Raine was impressed by how accurate the film's depiction of the psychology of a murderer was. In an interview with Vanity Fair, he described it as \"a great educational tool\" and stated that he planned to present film clips during his classes. Psychiatrist Kamran Ahmed highlighted the factors in Arthur's childhood such as parental abuse and loss and family history of mental illness in the genesis of his condition. American psychiatrist Imani Walker, who is known for her Bravo television series Married to Medicine Los Angeles and working with violent criminals with mental disorders, analyzed the Joker's apparent mental disorders and circumstances and noted that Arthur tries to find help before his downfall, only to be abandoned. She says of Arthur and others in poverty who have mental illness: \"We as a society don't even pretend that they're real people and that's what this movie is about. He never had a chance.\" Forensic psychiatrist Ziv Cohen criticized the film as misrepresenting the mentally ill as violent. He argued the film conflates psychopathy (a lack of conscience) with mental illness, thereby creating a false impression of the mentally ill as dangerous.\nMicah Uetricht, managing director of Jacobin, opined in a review published by The Guardian that he was shocked that the media did not understand the movie's message: \"we got a fairly straightforward condemnation of American austerity: how it leaves the vulnerable to suffer without the resources they need and the horrific consequences for the rest of society that can result\"; Uetricht thus declares that Joker presents a world that has devolved into \"barbarism\". Uetricht states that these themes are unsubtle to the extent that it was surprising that most media outlets had not identified them. Ahmed also highlights the lack of funding for already-stretched mental health services worldwide being alluded to.\nAlison Willmore wrote in Vulture that the film has \"impossible\" and \"deliberately contradictory\" politics.\nThe film's director and co-screenwriter, Todd Phillips, has stated that Joker is \"certainly not a political film\". Phillips has also commented on discourse surrounding the film, pushing back on several criticisms of its themes. He responded to critics who have expressed concerns over the film's violence, saying \"Isn't it good to have these discussions about these movies, about violence? Why is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it?\" Phillips also commented on political backlash to the film, saying \"What's outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It's really been eye-opening for me.\"\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\nDuring a Five Star Movement event in October 2019, Italian comedian and politician Beppe Grillo gave a speech wearing the Joker's makeup. Yusuke Kawai, a candidate for governor of Chiba Prefecture, appeared on NHK with a Joker costume in 2021. References to the character were also found in anti-government protests worldwide. During the 17 October Revolution, a group of graffiti artists called Ashekm painted a mural of the Joker holding a Molotov cocktail and it was also reported that there was a Joker facepaint station at the protests in Beirut. In Los \u00c1ngeles, Chile, during the 2019\u20132022 Chilean protests, the phrase \"We are all clowns\", which is adopted by Gotham City protesters in the movie, was written at the foot of a statue. In Hong Kong, protesters challenged an emergency decree prohibiting the wearing of masks by wearing those of fictional characters such as the Joker. In France, during the Yellow Vest Protests, firefighters donned Joker makeup holding placards. In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, Argentine president Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez compared the pictures of the protests to those seen in the film.\nOne of the locations seen in the film, a set of stairs in the Bronx, New York City, has been dubbed the Joker Stairs. The stairs have become a tourist destination and the subject of Internet memes, with visitors often reenacting the scene from the film in which Fleck dances down the stairs in his Joker attire. Ukrainian boxing champion Oleksandr Usyk wore a suit resembling that of Joker in a pre-fight press conference leading up to his fight with Anthony Joshua.\nIn 2020, Deadline listed it as one of the \"21 Most Influential Films Of The 21st Century, So Far,\" with Pete Hammond describing it as a film \"that emerged from a comic book to become a frightening comment on our own dark times, proving the genre from which it came is capable of being taken very seriously indeed.\" It also ranked 39 on Empire's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of the 21st Century,\" saying that \"it represented another mature evolution for the comic book movie \u2013 and proved that DC adaptations could thrive outside the Marvel-style universe structure.\"\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nJoker was intended to be a stand-alone film with no sequels but Warner Bros. greenlit a follow-up project. Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, with Phoenix and Beetz reprising their roles and Lady Gaga joining as Harley Quinn, was released on October 4, 2024, to negative reviews and a poor commercial performance.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nJoker at IMDb \nOfficial screenplay\nJoker at Instagram",
            "Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is a 2024 American jukebox musical psychological thriller film directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he co-wrote with Scott Silver. Loosely based on DC Comics characters, it is the sequel to Joker (2019). Joaquin Phoenix reprises his role as the Joker, with Lady Gaga as his love interest, Lee Quinzel. Zazie Beetz and Leigh Gill also reprise their roles, while Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Steve Coogan and Harry Lawtey join the cast. It is produced by Warner Bros. Pictures in association with Joint Effort and was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.\nJoker was conceived as a standalone film, although Warner Bros. intended the film to launch a DC Black film series. Phillips, director of Joker, expressed interest in making a sequel, which was announced in June 2022, with Gaga and Beetz joining later that year. Principal photography took place in New York City, Los Angeles, and Belleville, New Jersey, from December 2022 to April 2023.\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux premiered at the 81st Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2024, and was released in the United States on October 4.  The film was a critical and commercial failure, having grossed $201 million on a $190\u2013200 million budget, with projections of a $125\u2013200 million loss for Warner Bros.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn an animated sequence, the Joker is impersonated by his shadow, who acts violently and takes his place to perform his singing number for a TV show, and then abandons him on stage, before three police officers arrive and attack him.\nArthur Fleck is in custody at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the crimes he committed two years prior. His lawyer, Maryanne Stewart, plans to argue that Arthur suffers from dissociative identity disorder and that his Joker personality is responsible for the crimes. At a music therapy session, Arthur meets Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel, who claims that she grew up in the same neighborhood he did, had an abusive father who died in a car crash, and was imprisoned after burning down her parents' apartment building. Lee also expresses her admiration for the Joker's crimes and personality.\nDuring a film screening, Lee starts a fire. She and Arthur are caught trying to escape, and Arthur is placed in solitary confinement. Lee visits him to say she is being released to avoid his influence but promises to attend his trial. During an interview with television personality Paddy Meyers, Arthur sings to Lee through the TV screen, deepening her love for him.\nOn the day of the trial, Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent calls witnesses who dismiss Arthur's claims of insanity. During a break, Maryanne reveals that Lee was actually a psychiatry student who grew up in the Upper West Side, and her father, a doctor, is alive. Furthermore, she voluntarily committed herself at Arkham, checked herself out, and never burned down an apartment building. When Arthur confronts Lee, she confesses that her lies were an effort to get close to Arthur but also tells him that she is pregnant from their night together and has moved into his old apartment building to create a home for them.\nAt the trial the next day, Arthur dismisses Maryanne and represents himself. After bringing Arthur's former co-worker Gary Puddles and neighbor Sophie Dumond to the stand, Dent rests his case. Arthur, visibly affected by Gary's testimony, offers no defense, although, during his speech, he mocks the Arkham guards and indicates that they abuse him. Returning to Arkham, he is taken to the showers by head guard Jackie Sullivan and two guards in retaliation, where he is stripped and violently raped. Ricky, an inmate and friend of Arthur, verbally confronts the guards, resulting in Jackie strangling him to death out of rage unsatisfied after Arthur kept laughing at him.\nDuring his closing argument in court the following day, a devastated Arthur renounces his Joker persona, taking full responsibility for his actions. Enraged at this, Lee storms out, and the jury finds Arthur guilty of murder. As the foreperson reads the verdict, a car bomb explodes outside the courthouse, killing and injuring numerous attendees and scarring half of Dent's face. In the chaos, two followers help Arthur escape.\nArthur wanders through Gotham City and encounters Lee outside his old apartment, but she rejects him for renouncing his Joker persona. As she leaves, the police apprehend Arthur and bring him back to Arkham. The next day, a young inmate approaches Arthur and begins telling a joke before repeatedly stabbing Arthur in the abdomen. As Arthur bleeds to death, his assailant carves a smile on his own face while laughing hysterically.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck / Joker, a mentally ill nihilistic criminal with a clown-inspired persona, formerly an impoverished party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian. Director Todd Phillips said that while the film would venture further into Arthur's psyche, he would not become the \"Clown Prince of Crime\", as his Joker persona is an unwilling symbol to people who give him the love he always wanted.\nLady Gaga as Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel, a patient at Arkham State Hospital who becomes obsessed with Arthur and forms a deadly romantic relationship with him. Describing Lee, Phillips noted how this version of the character is manipulative, amoral and \"more grounded\", with the film deliberately ignoring much of the character's classic mannerisms and style to fit into the world created in Joker (2019). Gaga felt Lee to be a \"study of contradictions\", as her love and obsession for Arthur is also admiration and disgust, being both truthful and dishonest, really dangerous yet completely peaceful, deeming Lee a \"very nonlinear person\" like everyone involved in storytelling and thinking she was the \"more real\" the \"more she could be a contradiction\".\nBrendan Gleeson as Jackie Sullivan, an abusive guard at Arkham State Hospital.\nCatherine Keener as Maryanne Stewart, Arthur's lawyer.\nZazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond, a single mother and Arthur's former neighbor, whom Arthur imagined being in a romantic relationship with.\nSteve Coogan as Paddy Meyers, a popular TV personality who interviews Arthur in Arkham.\nHarry Lawtey as Harvey Dent, the newly elected assistant district attorney who plans to bring Arthur to justice for his crimes. Lawtey developed his own backstory for the character to accurately play the role, with Phillips instilling in him the idea that, in the dawn of televised trials, Dent is cynically willing to put Arthur on trial for his own gain. To prepare for the role, Lawtey avoided watching the versions of Harvey Dent in Batman (1989), Batman Forever (1995), The Dark Knight (2008) and Batman vs. Two-Face (2017) portrayed by Billy Dee Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, Aaron Eckhart and William Shatner respectively. Phillips confirmed that one of the film's shots meant to signal the character's eventual descent into his Two-Face persona from the source material, affirming that he and his crew tried to come up with a realistic answer as to why certain things happen.\nLeigh Gill as Gary Puddles, Arthur's former clown co-worker whose life he spared.\nKen Leung as Dr. Victor Liu, a psychologist who gives his testimony diagnosing Arthur at the trial.\nJacob Lofland as Ricky Meline, an inmate at Arkham who admires Arthur.\nBill Smitrovich as Judge Herman Rothwax, who presides over Arthur's trial.\nSharon Washington as Debra Kane, Arthur's former social worker.\nAdditionally, Connor Storrie appears as a young Arkham inmate who watches Arthur in secret throughout the film before murdering him and seemingly taking over his persona, though Phillips did not confirm if this character is the Joker who becomes Batman's enemy. Tim Dillon appears as an Arkham Asylum guard who asks Arthur to sign his book, Marc Maron's likeness as Gene Ufland is used for the book and archive footage of both Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin and Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck is used.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nJoker (2019) was intended to be a standalone film. Warner Bros. intended for it to launch DC Black, a line of DC Comics\u2013based films unrelated to the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) franchise with darker, more experimental material, similar to the DC Black Label comics publisher. However, even before the film wrapped, Joaquin Phoenix told director Todd Phillips that he did not feel ready to leave Arthur Fleck behind; one night while falling asleep, Phoenix had a dream of his character performing onstage, telling jokes and singing, giving him the idea of possibly doing a musical sequel. They then brought the idea to producer Toby Emmerich. While Phillips said in August 2019 that he would be interested in making a sequel, depending on the film's performance and if Phoenix was interested, he later clarified that \"the movie's not set up to [have] a sequel. We always pitched it as one movie, and that's it.\"\nIn October 2019, Phoenix spoke of reprising his role as Arthur Fleck, saying: \"I can't stop thinking about it... if there's something else, we can do with Joker that might be interesting.\" In another interview, he said: \"It's nothing that I really wanted to do prior to working on this movie. I don't know that there is [more to do] ... Because it seemed endless, the possibilities of where we can go with the character.\" He was paid $20 million for his involvement. As the film went on to earn more than $1 billion, Phoenix and Phillips thought about a possible follow-up in the form of a Broadway theatre show. They did not consider making a conventional sequel depicting Arthur's development into Batman's nemesis by turning him into the Clown Prince of Crime or putting him in charge of a criminal syndicate, despite the original film's depiction of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. Phillips preferred to focus on how Arthur's breakdown captivated Gotham, being interested in examining how the very idea of entertainment went from movies and television to whatever scandal the news currently air.\nIn November 2019, The Hollywood Reporter reported that a sequel was in development, with Phillips, writer Scott Silver and Phoenix reprising their duties. However, Deadline Hollywood reported the same day that The Hollywood Reporter's story was false and that negotiations had not even begun. Phillips responded to the reports by saying that he had discussed a sequel with Warner Bros., and it remained a possibility, but it was not in development. Phillips and Phoenix started seriously considering the idea of making a Broadway sequel show to Joker at the Carlisle Theatre. After the original plans were changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Phillips and Silver began developing a sequel while still considering Phoenix's musical concept. Phillips found the idea risky and \"dangerous\" enough to give the film \"audacity and complexity\" with music, dance, drama, courtroom drama, comedy, happiness and sadness and a traditional love story. Aware that young moviegoers may not be interested due to preferring usual comic book films, Phillips banked on their \"appetite\" for something new and different to help the film differentiate itself from remakes and reboots. Phoenix suggested the idea of teaming Arthur with a \"female Joker\" that could serve as his dance partner in a \"kind of psychotic tango\". This led Phillips and Silver to the idea of including Harley Quinn, a female villain associated with the Joker and first introduced in Batman: The Animated Series, to serve that purpose.\nIn early June 2022, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy took over as co-heads of Warner Bros.'s movie studio, with the greenlighting of a sequel to Joker being one of their first actions. In June 2022, Phillips confirmed that the sequel was in development, with a script by him and Silver. The film was also revealed to be titled Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux. By February 2023, DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn confirmed that Folie \u00e0 Deux would be a DC Elseworlds project, taking place outside the main cinematic DC Universe (DCU). Phillips's goal for the film was to make it feel like it had been produced by \"crazy people\", but struggled with referring to the film as a \"musical\", as the film lacks traditional musical numbers, and most of the music contains dialogue, with songs like \"Get Happy\", \"For Once in My Life\" and \"That's Life\" being played when Arthur cannot pronounce the words he wants to say, with those songs conveying the emotions Arthur Fleck and Harley Quinn feel with what they seek in their relationships, with the former being drawn to romantic ballads and the latter preferring music about power.\nIn July 2024,  Lady Gaga commented on the singing required of her: \"It was unlike anything I've ever done before. [...] For me, there's plenty of notes, actually, from Lee. I'm a trained singer, right? So even my breathing was different when I sang as Lee. When I breathe to sing on stage, I have this very controlled way to make sure that I'm on pitch and it's sustained at the right rhythm and amount of time, but Lee would never know how to do any of that. So, it's like removing the technicality of the whole thing, removing my perceived art-form from it all and completely being inside of who she is.\" Phillips also said of this specific interpretation of the character, \"While there are some things that people would find familiar in her, it's really Gaga's own interpretation, and Scott [Silver, co-writer] and I's interpretation. She became the way how Manson had girls that idolized him. The way that sometimes these [imprisoned murderers] have people that look up to them. There are things about Harley in the movie that were taken from the comic books, but we took it and made it to the way we wanted it to be.\" Despite Gaga and Phoenix showing off their musical skills in past projects, Phillips did not require them to sing professionally, preferring a \"rawer, more unstable sound\" that fluctuated between euphoria and despair, which occasionally required singing off-key. The filmmakers asked themselves what needed to happen for two individuals to break into song in the middle of a conversation and where the music could come from when no one but the protagonists can hear it. They rationalized that the main characters are not, or should sound like, professional singers with vibrato and perfect notes, instead sounding \"nerve-racking but honest\".\nIn August 2024, it was reported that the film would open with a Looney Tunes\u2013inspired cartoon animated by The Triplets of Belleville animator Sylvain Chomet, which would be followed by prison riots, courtroom legal fights and a variety show sequence that has Phoenix and Gaga portrayed as a homicidal Sonny & Cher. The film's ending, which sees a younger Arkham Asylum inmate carving a Glasgow smile for himself after a violent altercation with Arthur, was originally planned for the first film's original scripted ending according to one source, with Arthur carving himself one in front of his crowd of supporters. However, Christopher Nolan did not allow the filmmakers to go through the idea as he mandated that only Heath Ledger's version of the Joker from his film The Dark Knight (2008) should have a Glasgow smile. By the time Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux entered development, Nolan and his company Syncopy Inc. no longer worked with Warner Bros. after disagreements with their release treatment for Tenet (2020) by quickly sending it to Max, having moved on since 2021 to Universal Pictures to direct Oppenheimer (2023), hence allowing Phillips and his crew to implement the idea in the film with the patient who encounters Arthur.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nDays after the film's official announcement, it was announced Gaga was in talks to portray Harley Quinn and that the film would be a musical. Gaga accepted the role due to seeing the part as a new challenge that was something she had not done previously after her film appearances in A Star is Born (2018) and House of Gucci (2021) as well as she recognizing having two extremes in identity and duality as her character applied to her two due to complicatedly having like a second life in her celebrity singer persona. Gaga would confirm her casting later that summer. She received $12 million for her involvement. In August 2022, it was reported Zazie Beetz was in negotiations to reprise her role as Sophie Dumond in the film. Beetz was confirmed to be reprising her role the following month, alongside the cast additions of Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Jacob Lofland. Gleeson joined the project out of his admiration for both Phoenix's \"indelible\" performance in the first film and Gaga, but admitted to being \"kinda intimidated\" by what he had to do for his role. In October, Harry Lawtey joined the cast in what Deadline Hollywood reported as a \"big role\", later revealed to be that of Harvey Dent by the film's official trailer. Lawtey taped an audition for Phillips, consisting of a recorded self-talk between himself and a friend of his, just as HBO renewed Industry (2020\u2013present) in Fall 2022, not expecting to get the role, for which he had no information. A couple of weeks later, Lawtey had a video call with Phillips, during which he offered him the role of Dent straight away even though his team assumed it was going to be a note session for a second read.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography began on December 10, 2022, with Phillips releasing a first look on his Instagram account and Lawrence Sher serving as cinematographer. Sher had cited Francis Ford Coppola's One from the Heart (1982) as a source of visual inspiration for the film. Exterior filming occurred in New York City and Los Angeles by March 2023. Gaga had filmed scenes with a crowd of extras demanding Joker's arrest outside the New York County Courthouse, which had led some onlookers nearby to mistake it for Trump's arrest following his first indictment. Arkham Asylum scenes were filmed at the abandoned Essex County Isolation Hospital in Belleville, New Jersey. In April 2023, filming took place at the \"Joker Stairs\", the stairway on West 167th Street in the Bronx featured prominently in the first film. Filming officially wrapped on April 5, 2023. The film is shot entirely with IMAX-certified digital cameras, including the Arri Alexa 65, the same camera used in filming for Joker.\nUnlike many musicals that have actors sing along to a pre-recorded track, Phoenix and Gaga performed the musical numbers live, accompanied by a piano player who performed off-camera keeping up with whatever tempo they established. Meanwhile, Phillips tried to sync the radically different takes into a coherent whole in the editing room, describing the experience as a \"nightmare\".\nPaparazzi photos from the film's set depicted a shot of Lady Gaga kissing a woman in a key scene during Arthur's trial, in which Lee would have passed a group of protestors and plant a kiss on the woman (which Gaga allegedly improvised) before proceeding to meet with Arthur as in the finished film, where she does a soft song and dance number beforehand. However, Phillips nixed the shot and left it as a deleted scene once he realized that it required dialogue from the woman which would have ruined the moment's vibe.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn December 2023, Gunn revealed he reviewed shot material and gave his notes regarding it, but had no involvement with the film otherwise. It was later reported that his and Peter Safran's notes were rejected by Philips, who \"wanted nothing to do with DC\" while making the film. He was also given an extraordinary level of autonomy and power over the final cut, allowing him to bypass any oversight from the brand's gatekeepers and distancing himself from it despite Gunn's support for the film. This resulted in no DC executives being involved as the film was greenlit when the studio was in a chaotic restructure and the lack of the DC Studios logo in the film's opening sequence. The film was also not test screened in advance, though insiders claimed this was a mutual agreement between Phillips and the studio to prevent leaks about spoilers, even though past \"spoiler-heavy plotted\" films like the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Avengers: Endgame (2019) had multiple test screenings.\nThe film was more expensive than its predecessor, which had a budget of around $60 million, with some publications noting the costs for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux as high as $200 million, though Phillips denied that figure. It was later reported that the inflated budget was due to Philips's insistence of shooting in expensive areas such as downtown Los Angeles, despite the studio's insistence of shooting on their set in London (which would have saved up to $12 million), as well as Phillips, Phoenix, and Gaga being paid a combined $52 million. According to some sources, while backed by FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith, Alcon Entertainment put up Village Roadshow's portion from the first film with an eagerness to have a stake in the production, but Zaslav's Warner Bros. regime wanted to profit more from the film and agreed just one co-financier, its slate financing partner Domain Entertainment. Industrial Light & Magic provided the visual effects.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nHildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir composed the film's score, returning from the first film. The film includes 16 musical numbers, most of them covers of pre-existing songs, with one original song written by Lady Gaga. Gaga released a \"companion album\", Harlequin, on September 27, 2024.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\nA teaser trailer for the film was released on April 10, 2024, while Warner Bros. screened a presentation at the 2024 CinemaCon, being promoted by Phillips. It features Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones's cover of the song \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\" (1965). Christi Carras from Los Angeles Times felt the film's presentation as a musical adhered to a trend where movie studios seemed reluctant to promote their films as musicals, citing Wonka (2023) and Mean Girls (2024) as examples. Writing for Variety, Rebecca Rubin called the footage \"dark and gritty\" and highlighted the portrayal of Quinn as being Fleck's \"demented muse\". TheWrap's Jeremy Fuster and Stephanie Kaloi described the trailer as focusing on Quinn and Fleck's \"wild, destructive love\". The trailer gained 167 million views in 24 hours, being Warner Bros.' biggest trailer premiere at the time, having surpassed that of the first trailer for Barbie (2023).\nPhillips revealed during a Q&A session with IGN that he originally intended to shoot a trailer for the in-universe television film about Arthur Fleck's story mentioned in the film, confirming that it starred Ethan Chase, Justin Theroux's character from the first film, having planned for Theroux to reprise the role to shoot it. Plans for the trailer were scrapped due to time.\n\n\n== Release ==\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux had the world premiere at the 81st Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2024. Warner Bros. insiders claim that the studio didn't want to premiere the film in that festival as they had done back in 2019 with Joker, but Phillips pushed back until they accepted, though a spokesperson said Warner fully supported the decision to screen the film in Venice. The film was released theatrically in the United States on October 4, 2024, by Warner Bros. Pictures. At their 2024 CineEurope presentation, Warner Bros. announced that the film would be released overseas on October 2, 2024, two days before the domestic premiere.\nFollowing the success of Oppenheimer (2023) and Dune: Part Two (2024) in the format, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux was released in the IMAX 15-perforation 70 mm film format to eleven venues worldwide.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux was released on Digital HD on October 29, 2024.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nAs of October 28, 2024, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has grossed $57.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $143.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $201.4 million. Variety reported the film's break-even point as $450 million, with Warner Bros. putting it at $375 million; the publication later reported estimates that it would lose the studio between $125\u2013200 million during its theatrical run.\nFive weeks ahead of release, Boxoffice Pro projected that the film would \"easily\" gross at least $100 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada and outgross its predecessor's debut of $96.2 million, with estimates at $115\u2013145 million despite it receiving mixed reviews at Venice like its predecessor. Two weeks after, projections dropped to $70 million, and the week of release, estimates became $55\u201360 million. After it made $20 million on its first day, including an estimated $7 million from Thursday night previews, projections dropped again to $45 million for the weekend. It went on to debut at $37.7 million from 4,102 theaters, topping the box office but coming below expectations. Several outlets compared the film's opening weekend gross to that of other recent high-profile box office bombs The Marvels (2023) and Madame Web (2024), noting that Folie \u00e0 Deux's own debut made less than either. Deadline Hollywood attributed the opening to fans of the original not wanting to see a musical.\nJeff Goldstein, the studio's president of domestic distribution, acknowledged the film's performance in an article by The Wall Street Journal, mentioning that the sequel was a \"deeper dive into mental illness\" and making guesses about some of the film's core audience (particularly males) struggling to connect with this new direction for the character of Lee. Wall Street financial analyst Dan Ives deemed the film a \"black eye\" for Warner Bros. at a key time, with the industry having expected the film to be a hit. Variety also attributed the film's underperformance to Bradley Cooper's lack of participation on it with his commercial instincts unlike its predecessor, as Cooper dissolved his producing partnership with Phillips in 2021. Variety noted that since the commercial success of The Batman (2022), Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is the sixth live-action film based on DC characters to financially underperform, following the DC Extended Universe films Black Adam (2022), Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, Blue Beetle and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (all 2023). A Warner Bros. insider opined that the film put more pressure than ever on Superman (2025), which Gunn and Safran hope to use to \"right the ship\". In its second weekend, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux made $7 million, a record-breaking 81% drop for a DC film. The film's second weekend gross fell below the debut of Terrifier 3 (2024), an independent horror movie, which had topped the box office in its opening weekend at number one. The following weekend the film lost 1,245 theaters and made $2.2 million, dropping another 69% and finishing in sixth.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nPublications described the critical consensus upon Folie \u00e0 Deux's release as either negative or mixed. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 32% of 343 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Joaquin Phoenix's eponymous Joker takes the stand in a sequel that dances around while the story remains still, although Lady Gaga's wildcard energy gives Folie \u00e0 Deux some verve.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 45 out of 100, based on 62 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D\" on an A+ to F scale (the lowest grade ever for a comic book film), while those surveyed by PostTrak gave the film a 40% overall positive score\u2014an average rating of 1/2 out of five stars\u2014with \"a very low\" 24% saying they would definitely recommend it.\nPete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood felt Folie \u00e0 Deux was \"brilliant\" and that the \"production values across the board are excellent, particularly returning Lawrence Sher's cinematography, the production design of Mark Friedberg, and costumes from Arianna Phillips\". William Bibbiani of TheWrap gave the film a positive review, writing that it was \"the most interesting film about Arthur Fleck. It's genuinely a little daring, genuinely a little challenging, and genuinely a little genuine\". Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent described the film as \"deeply unsettling\". In his four stars out of five review for The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin lauded the film for its musical numbers and Phillips for \"stay[ing] true to the project's nihilistic ethos,\" while noting Lady Gaga was \"magnetic but underused\". Rafa Sales Ross of The Playlist echoed similar thoughts on the use of Gaga but enjoyed Phoenix \"in a much more contained turn, a welcome change to those put off by the constant, annoyingly loud cackling that permeated much of the previous instalment\".\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave Folie \u00e0 Deux three out of five. He praised the opening, the supporting cast and the \"real spark\" in the first encounter between the two protagonists, but wrote that \"the whole movie finally turns out to be oppressively, claustrophobically and repetitively becalmed in that oddly unreal Gotham-universe jail with Phoenix and Gaga kept apart for long periods\". Bradshaw found that \"Phoenix's own performance is as single-note as before, though certainly as forceful and his screen presence is potent\" and that Gaga \"brings a sly and manipulative malice\" to her character. In a mixed review for KQED-FM, Jack Coyle wrote: \"Laudable as the intentions of Folie \u00e0 Deux may be, it feels thoughtfully but tiresomely stuck in the past\". In a negative review for ABC News, Luke Goodsell wrote: \"That Joker was intended as a standalone movie is evident from the new sequel ... a quasi-musical courtroom drama that has little interest in advancing any kind of story. In fact, it's even more deliberately obtuse and anti-crowd-pleasing than its predecessor\".\nUSA Today reported that the negative reviews \"argued the musical numbers are underwhelming and Gaga's talents are not well-utilized\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times stated the film was \"such a dour, unpleasant slog that it is hard to know why it was made or for whom,\" and that \"Phoenix's sour frown, the movie's barely-there story, its unrelenting grimness and its commitment to forced eccentricity suggest that no one involved was really stoked to make it\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave a scathing review, stating the film \"perversely denies audiences everything they've been conditioned to want from it; gently at first, and then later with the unmistakable hostility of a knife to the gut,\" and that \"its turgid symphony of unexpected cameos, mournful cello solos, and implied sexual violence is too dissonant to appreciate even on its own terms\". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic lamented that the film has \"nothing interesting to say about the challenge of fame\" and feels like \"punish[ment] for the crime of wanting to be entertained\". Justin Clark of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four, writing that \"Folie \u00e0 Deux's attempt at showcasing cleverness, verve, or engagement is held cruelly underwater by staid direction, shoddy emotional plotting, a gleeful sense of cruelty, and a grave nihilism that makes Zack Snyder's work seem like a season of Bluey\". Kyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal said, \"The falloff in quality from Joker, a genuinely searing innovation in comic-book movies, to this one is so steep that it's comparable to the dropoff between The Hangover and The Hangover Part II\". David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter found the film \"frustrating\" and its plot \"a little thin and at times dull\", and disliked how the film \"all but neutralizes [the Joker]\" and \"reduces the archvillain to a hollowed-out product of childhood trauma and mental illness\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety also criticized its plot, deeming it \"overly cautious\" and lacking in execution. He found Gaga, with her \"lovely unforced presence\", was \"drastically underused ... Her Lee never quite takes wing\".\nA source close to the production deemed the release as a \"complete audience rejection\". Another described it as \"a very expensive art film\" whose intended audience was Phoenix. According to another source, Phillips spent the weekend release of Folie \u00e0 Deux secluded on a ranch property he owns. A source directly involved in the film acknowledged that no one could reach Phillips, and that his rejection of fan expectations sealed its failure and harmed the DC brand. The box office analyst Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations called the film \"a Speed 2 level of disaster\" with Warner massively overspending on the film, only for audiences to show very little interest, seemingly as a result of the filmmakers making creative choices that did not align with fan expectations.\n\n\n=== Themes and analysis ===\nCritics noted that the film was a work of metafiction designed to intentionally antagonize audiences who were fans of the first film. Rather than capitulating to expectations of the predecessor's fanbase that Arthur would fully embrace his Joker persona and go on to become Batman's archenemy, the film serves to rebuke those who idolized the character of the Joker. As a deliberate anti-audience effort, the film pushes against the notion of fan service, instead creating a self-aware narrative that is a commentary on its own existence. The film features off-key musical sequences that contrast with fan expectations following the original film, during one such scene Joker acknowledges, \"I don't think we're giving the people what they want\". Lee Quinzel can be viewed as a stand-in for audiences who were fans of the first film, with her comments about becoming obsessed with Joker after having seen a TV movie based on his life reflecting the audience. Lee represents an affluent fan who desires the anarchy and exotic thrill Joker represents, and like the audience, is upset and disappointed when Arthur fails to live up to his Joker identity.\nThe finale where Arthur's crimes are trialed and he is made to seem sad and pathetic represents an effort by Phillips to subvert and undermine audiences who saw Arthur as heroic in the first film, and the trial reiterates the events of the first film in a way that is intended to be dissatisfying and alienating to audiences. Likewise, Arthur renouncing his Joker persona before being unceremoniously killed by an unnamed inmate who seemingly becomes the next Joker has also been interpreted as a deliberate attempt by the filmmakers to disappoint audiences, subversively denying fans their desire for a heroic or sympathetic narrative as well as causing them to question who the true Joker of both films' titles is. Ultimately the metafiction reflects Arthur's characterisation; just as his society only cares for him for what he represents as the Joker and rejects him when he renounces that persona, so too does the audience reject Arthur. As a result, many felt the film to be a \"very expensive punch line\" for the same audiences who saw the first film.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Future ==\nIn October 2024, Phillips stated he has no plans to make further DC films, rejecting the notion of making either a third Joker film or a spin-off centered on Lee.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Quotations related to Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux at Wikiquote\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux at IMDb",
            "Jonah Hex is a 2010 American Western superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Directed by Jimmy Hayward (in his live-action debut) from a screenplay by Neveldine/Taylor, the film stars Josh Brolin in the title role, John Malkovich, Megan Fox, Michael Fassbender, Will Arnett, Michael Shannon and Wes Bentley.\nProduced by Legendary Pictures, Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance Productions and Akiva Goldsman's Weed Road Pictures, the film was released on June 18, 2010, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was a commercial failure, having grossed only $11 million against a budget of $47 million. It received generally negative reviews from critics.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJonah Hex is a Confederate soldier who refuses an order from his commanding officer Quentin Turnbull to burn down a hospital. Hex is forced to kill his best friend Jeb, Turnbull's son, who draws a pistol on Hex. Turnbull later tracks Hex down at home and takes revenge for Jeb's death by killing Hex's family and branding Hex's face. Hex is found near death and healed by the Crow people; the experience leaves him with the ability to speak to the dead. Turnbull fakes his death in a hotel fire and Hex, unable to seek revenge, becomes a bounty-hunter.\nIn 1876, a gang of men led by Turnbull hijack a train carrying components of an experimental weapon invented by Eli Whitney. President Ulysses S. Grant realizes that Turnbull is planning to rebuild the weapon and use it to attack the U.S. on the Fourth of July. Grant instructs Army Lieutenant Grass to find Hex and hire him to track down and stop Turnbull. Grass' men find Hex in a brothel with a prostitute named Lilah and inform him that Turnbull is still alive.\nHex travels to meet Grass at his encampment and uses his ability to interrogate a dead soldier. The soldier tells Hex to find former Confederate Colonel Slocum, who now runs an illegal fighting pavilion in South Carolina. Hex confronts Slocum, who refuses to reveal Turnbull's location and sarcastically suggests he ask his dead friend Jeb. Hex throws Slocum to his death and burns the pavilion down. He decides to travel to Gettysburg and dig up Jeb's body to ask him for help. Jeb and Hex briefly fight before Jeb accepts Hex's apology for killing him. He grudgingly reveals that his father is at Fort Resurrection. Jeb also warns Hex to avoid death because many in the afterlife have plans for him.\nHex confronts Turnbull at the fort and kills several men before he is shot point blank in the chest. Hex escapes by horse and travels back to find the Crow people. Turnbull orders a man named Burke, who helped kill Hex's family, to track down something Hex loves and bring it to him. While Hex is being healed again, Burke finds and kidnaps Lilah. Turnbull assembles the weapon and conducts a test on a small town in Georgia, completely destroying it.\nHex sends a message to Lt. Grass with Turnbull's location and requests backup. Hex travels to Independence Harbor and infiltrates Turnbull's ironclad warship. He kills Burke, using his abilities to bring him back from the dead and incinerate him. Turnbull holds Lilah at gunpoint and forces Hex to surrender. Hex and Lilah escape their holding cell as Lt. Grass arrives and attempts to arrest Turnbull. Grass and his crew are destroyed by the weapon and Turnbull begins his attack on Washington, D.C.\nHex attacks Turnbull, as they fight Hex jams the weapon with a hatchet before locking Turnbull's neck in the machine. Hex and Lilah escape the boat as the weapon backfires and explodes, killing Turnbull and all of his men. The next day, President Ulysses S. Grant gives Jonah Hex a large reward and a full pardon before offering him a job as Sheriff of the entire United States. Hex declines, but assures the president that they can find him if they need him; he leaves the city with Lilah.\nThe film ends with Jonah Hex visiting Jeb's grave to apologize for his father's death before riding off.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJosh Brolin as Jonah Hex: A disfigured bounty-hunter who is the film's anti-heroic protagonist. Brolin initially hated the script, but changed his mind after growing to like its tongue-in-cheek tone.\nJohn Malkovich as Quentin Turnbull: The main antagonist who murdered Jonah Hex's family and disfigured the former.\nMegan Fox as Lilah Black: A gun-wielding prostitute and Jonah's love interest, whose real name is Tallulah Black. Though her performance was widely critiqued at the time, Fox would later remark that \"I shouldn't have been nominated for an Oscar for it, [but] I'm definitely not bad in it.\"\nMichael Fassbender as Burke: A bowler-hat-wearing, tattooed and psychopathic Irishman who is Turnbull's right-hand man. Fassbender likens his character to that of The Riddler and Malcolm McDowell's performance in A Clockwork Orange, saying he mainly found his character when he tried on the derby bowler.\nWill Arnett as Lieutenant Grass: A Union soldier who enlists Hex as a bounty-hunter.\nMichael Shannon as Dr. Cross Williams: The ringleader of a gladiator circus. The studio planned to have Williams in a recurring character if a sequel surfaced.\nWes Bentley as Adleman Lusk: A corrupt politician.\nAidan Quinn as Ulysses S. Grant: The 18th President of the United States (Quinn was on set for only 3 days for this role).\nLance Reddick as Smith: An armorer of sorts who supplies Hex with his new weapons.\nThe film also includes John Gallagher, Jr. as Lieutenant Evan, Tom Wopat as Colonel Slocum, and Julia Jones as Cassie; as well as an uncredited Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Jeb Turnbull. Mastodon guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds also made a small cameo appearance.\nPrior to Brolin's casting, actor Thomas Jane petitioned the studio for the role by hiring a makeup artist to give him the appearance of Jonah Hex. Jane instead voiced Hex in the 2010 animated short DC Showcase: Jonah Hex.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn 2000, 20th Century Fox developed a one-hour television adaptation based on the character, with producers Akiva Goldsman and Robert Zappia involved, but the project never came to fruition. In July 2007, Warner Bros. held the film rights to the character and sought to make a film. Goldsman paired with Andrew Lazar as producers, and Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor wrote the screenplay, which adapted an incarnation of the comic books that combined the Western genre with supernatural elements. In October 2008, Josh Brolin entered talks to be cast as Jonah Hex under the direction of Neveldine and Taylor. The following month, Neveldine and Taylor stepped down from being directors due to creative differences with the studio. The studio explored the possibility of hiring Andy Fickman or McG and by January 2009, it chose Jimmy Hayward (who previously directed Horton Hears a Who!) to direct Jonah Hex. By the following February, Brolin was set to star alongside John Malkovich, who was cast as the antagonist Quentin Turnbull. Filming began in Louisiana in April 2009. Director Francis Lawrence was brought in to supervise a number of reshoots.\nBrolin would later admit that he hated the experience making the film stating that at one point they had to \"[reshoot] 66 pages in 12 days\", implying that the filming schedule was hectic. He would go on to blame the film's failure on studio interference in the film's post-production. While he also called Hayward \"inexperienced\" and a \"bad choice (of director),\" he doesn't necessarily \"blame it all at him, because that was my choice, that was my bad choice.\" Initially Megan Fox was also very critical of the movie stating she doesn't even want her kids to see it: \"It would be nice to make some things that they can see, yeah, because something like Jennifer's Body I'm not going to let them see for a long time. Something like Jonah Hex I'm not going to let them see ever, no one should ever see that movie.\" She slowed down her feeling about it years after as she believes it was a \"decent\" movie: \"While I shouldn't have been nominated for an Oscar for it, I'm definitely not bad in it\".\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nHeavy metal band Mastodon scored the film. Troy Sanders, bassist/vocalist of Mastodon, on their contribution to the film:\n\"Some of it was heavy, some of it was very moody. A lot of it was spacey, Melvins B-sides, Pink Floyd-like, surreal outer space, like Neil Young's Dead Man. Swirling, nausea music\".\nSanders added that the collaboration felt natural: \"Since day one, we've always written albums thinking the music was the score of a movie. Then we'll create the lyrics or storyline on top of that, as if we're writing the dialog to match the movie's cinematography\".\nThe soundtrack is an hour-long instrumental, including five full songs and numerous smaller musical themes. Selections were added to scenes in the film by composer John Powell (Shrek, The Bourne Identity), and others were adapted for the London Orchestra for exceptionally epic moments. Sanders explained: \"We wrote variations on themes for each character, different variables for a bunch of riffs: faster, slower, heavier, lighter. It's the Darth Vader approach\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical ===\n\nThe film was released in the United States on June 18, 2010, the same day as Disney/Pixar's Toy Story 3.\n\n\n=== Merchandise ===\nTonner Doll Company, Inc. released in May 2010 Saloon Lilah as a doll.\nNECA has released an assortment of 3 action figures (Hex, Lilah, and Turnbull), and prop replicas from the film.\nWizKids has released a HeroClix Battle Pack consisting of Hex, Lilah, and Turnbull.\nDC Direct has released a Jonah Hex bust, a Lilah bust, and a 1:6 scale Jonah Hex Collector Figure.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\n\nThe film was released on both DVD and Blu-ray on October 19, 2010, with some special features (DVD contains Deleted Scenes). It was then released in the United Kingdom on December 13 the same year, on DVD, Blu-ray and Double Play. Special features include Deleted Scenes, The Inside Story of Jonah Hex and a Picture-In-Picture Commentary.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nJonah Hex failed at the box office, opening at No. 7 during its debut weekend with only $5,379,365 in 2,825 theaters, averaging $1,904 per theater. On its second weekend, the film only managed to gross $1,627,442, falling to No. 10. The film ended its theatrical run on August 12, 2010, having grossed only $10,547,117 in total on a $47 million budget. Due to its negative domestic take, the film was not widely released internationally, grossing less than $500,000 outside the United States.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, Jonah Hex has an approval rating of 12% based on 153 reviews and an average rating of 3.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Josh Brolin gives it his best shot, but he can't keep the short, unfocused Jonah Hex from collapsing on the screen\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nKeith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the film a rare \"F\" rating, stating \"the 81 minutes (including credits) of Jonah Hex footage that made it to the screen look like something assembled under a tight deadline, and possibly under the influence\". Roger Ebert gave the film a negative review, saying that the film \"is based on some DC Comics characters, which may explain the way the plot jumps around. We hear a lot about graphic novels, but this is more of a graphic anthology of strange occult ideas\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe film was named \"Worst Picture\" of the year by the Houston Film Critics Society at their 2010 awards ceremony. It was given two nominations at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Actress (Megan Fox) and Worst Screen Couple (Josh Brolin's face and Megan Fox's accent).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nJonah Hex at IMDb\nJonah Hex at Box Office Mojo\nJonah Hex at Rotten Tomatoes\nJonah Hex at Metacritic",
            "The Return of Swamp Thing is a 1989 American superhero film based on the DC Comics' character of the same name. Directed by Jim Wynorski, it is a sequel to the 1982 film Swamp Thing, having a lighter tone than its predecessor. The film has a main title montage consisting of comic book covers set to Creedence Clearwater Revival's \"Born on the Bayou\", and features Dick Durock and Louis Jourdan reprising their roles as Swamp Thing and Anton Arcane respectively, along with Sarah Douglas and Heather Locklear.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter her mother's mysterious death, Abigail Arcane travels to the Florida swamps to confront her evil stepfather Dr. Anton Arcane, who had been resurrected after his death in the first film.\nIn an attempt to stave off the effects of aging, Dr. Arcane, assisted by Dr. Lana Zurrell, combines genes from various swamp animals and human beings, creating an army of monsters known as Un-Men. Dr. Arcane captures Abby to use in his genetic experiments, but she is rescued by Swamp Thing, formerly scientist Alec Holland who was transformed into a bog creature after a confrontation with the evil doctor and his henchmen a few years earlier. \nArcane and his new hired guns track the pair and eventually re-capture Abby. During a final experiment where Arcane hopes to transfer Abby's living essence into his own body and make himself young again, Swamp Thing assaults the Arcane compound, killing most of his men. Knocking down doors, Swamp Thing barges into Arcane's laboratory to stop the experiment, but is attacked by one of his Un-Men, while Arcane becomes trapped under a heavy steel door. After a brief fight, Swamp Thing kills his Un-Men opponent, rescues Abby, and escapes with her before the entire building explodes, killing Arcane for good. \nSwamp Thing uses his regenerative powers to heal Abby. When she is revived, she expresses her love for Swamp Thing and her desire to stay with him in the swamps. Due to Arcane's experiments and Swamp Thing using his powers on her, Abby grows a flowering plant from her foot, signifying that she may become a female version of Swamp Thing. The two stroll into the swamps together, hand-in-hand.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn a 2018 interview, director Jim Wynorski recalled that he wanted Louis Jourdan to refer to the character of Miss Poinsettia as \"Points\". Jourdan refused because he knew that the character's nickname was a sexual-innuendo referring to her breasts. Wynorski then asked Jourdan, \"Weren't you just in a movie called Octopussy?\" Jourdan refused to speak to Wynorski for much of the shoot afterward.\nIn 2008, Dick Durock told Bullz-Eye.com that the suit made filming difficult: \"I hated the thought of having to go through the whole thing of wearing 50, 60, 70 pounds of weight in the summertime in Savannah, Georgia, but the money was there, and it's a job\".\nAccording to BPA, Locklear had a hard time working with the guy who played Swamp Thing in his human form: \"The model was full of himself and really rubbed Heather the wrong way. As soon as the model's scene was done, he was asked to leave the set\".\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nRCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video released the film in 1989 on VHS.\nThe film was issued on DVD by Image Entertainment, with a commentary by Wynorski which suggests that some of the film's humor was not as intentional as it seems and that Wynorski had a degree of contempt for the material. The DVD also includes two environmental public service announcements for television recorded with Durock in character and the two children featured in the film. The PSAs aired in certain markets in 1989.\nWarner Bros. re-released the film in April 2008 on DVD. A Blu-ray edition was released by the British label Screenbound Pictures in May 2017.\nMVD Entertainment Group released the film on Blu-ray/DVD combo pack May 8, 2018, as part of their MVD Rewind Collection line. The DVD extras were ported over along with a new commentary track and interviews with Jim Wynorski, composer Chuck Cirino, and editor Leslie Rosenthal, an interview with executive of Lightyear Entertainment Arnie Holland, plus a remastered 2K HD transfer.\nAn Ultra HD Blu-ray edition of the film was released on February 7, 2023.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nAs of October 2020, on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 44% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 3.92/10.\nVincent Canby of The New York Times gave a negative review, proclaiming the film \"is intended for people who missed the 1982 Swamp Thing and don't want the bother of renting the videocassette\". He added that it \"means to be funnier than it ever is\" and \"contains scenes of violence, most of which are so unconvincing as to be less scary than an average comic book\".\nA writer for Time Out gave a somewhat neutral review, stating that \"Wynorski is well-versed in double-bluffing his audience, denying them the chance of balking at dreadful special effects by implying that the ineptitude is deliberate. He opts for cheap nostalgic laughs and camp '50s sci-fi scenery; depending on whether you find this funny, you'll either smile knowingly or gasp in disbelief\". Another positive review was from Roger Ebert. He gave the movie a \"thumbs up\" when Gene Siskel did not in the talk show Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. Cinapse also gave the positive review as \"The Return Of Swamp Thing is a humorous and oddly sweet action adventure that wants nothing more than to entertain you with its quirkiness from start to finish\".\nBefore his death a year later, Dick Durock said in a 2008 interview that \"they tried in Return of Swamp Thing to make it comedy, campy, and that's tough to make that work. I think [for the TV series] they kind of gave up on that idea and got back to the darker side of the character as he was written in the comic book\".\nKathleen Norris published a poem referring to this film (\"Return of Swamp Thing\") in her book Journey: New and Selected Poems 1969-1999 (2001).\nDVD Talk rated the film 4 stars of 5 stars, reviewing it as \"Highly Recommended\".\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nHeather Locklear won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for her performance in the film.\n\n\n== Other media ==\n\n\n=== Novelization ===\nPeter David wrote a novelization of the film.

            "Road to Perdition is a 2002 American crime drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by David Self, based on the first volume of the graphic novel series of the same name by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. It stars Tom Hanks, Paul Newman (in his final live-action theatrical film role), Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Tyler Hoechlin in his film debut. Set in 1931 during the Great Depression, the film follows a mob enforcer and his son as they seek vengeance against the mobster who murdered the rest of their family. The film explores themes such as father-son relationships and the consequences of violence. \nRoad to Perdition was screened at the 59th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2002, where it was nominated for the Golden Lion. The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2002, and was a box office success, grossing over $181 million against its $80 million budget. It was well received by critics, who praised Mendes's direction, Conrad L. Hall's cinematography, and the performances of the cast. At the 75th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for Newman, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Art Direction. Hall was posthumously awarded the Oscar for Best Cinematography.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nMichael Sullivan, Sr. was orphaned and then raised by Irish Mob boss John Rooney in Rock Island, Illinois; unbeknownst to his own children, he is now Rooney's most fearsome enforcer. Rooney has come to love Sullivan more than he loves his own biological son, the rash and unpredictable Connor.\nSpeaking in 1931 at his brother's wake, Rooney associate Finn McGovern insinuates that Rooney is responsible for his brother's death. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to talk with McGovern. Sullivan's older son, twelve-year-old Michael Jr., watches the interaction through a hole in the wall. McGovern denies that his brother stole anything from the mob and implies that Connor was responsible for the theft. Connor shoots McGovern, forcing Sullivan to shoot the other armed witnesses in self-defense. Sullivan learns that Michael saw the shootout and swears him to secrecy.\nRooney sends Sullivan to collect a debt from Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads the letter and reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads, \"Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid\". Sullivan rushes home. When he arrives, he discovers that Connor has already murdered his wife, Annie, and their younger son, Peter. Michael was unharmed, as he had arrived home late from detention.\nSullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet mobster Frank Nitti. Sullivan offers to work for the Chicago Outfit in exchange for permission to kill Connor. Nitti rejects his offer and advises Sullivan against seeking revenge. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch freelance killer Harlen Maguire to kill Sullivan. Maguire tracks the Sullivans to a roadside diner. Maguire and Sullivan have a seemingly casual conversation while Michael stays in the car. Sensing the danger, Sullivan escapes the diner through the bathroom window and slashes Maguire's tires before driving away.\nSullivan begins robbing the banks that hold the Outfit's money; in so doing, he hopes to pressure the Outfit into withdrawing their protection from Connor. Sullivan teaches Michael to drive so that he can act as a getaway driver. The mob withdraws money from its banks, frustrating Sullivan's plan. He visits Rooney's accountant, Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. Rance is killed in the crossfire before Sullivan wounds Maguire and escapes with Rooney's ledgers. During the escape, Maguire shoots Sullivan in the shoulder. Michael drives them to a farm after Sullivan collapses from his wound, and an elderly childless husband and wife at the farm help him recover. \nThe ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father. Believing that Rooney will call off the hit on him if he knows the truth, Sullivan heads back to Chicago. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass and finds Rooney already knows that Connor has been robbing him. Rooney states that he expects that Connor will either be killed by Sullivan or be killed by Nitti's men after Rooney has died. Nevertheless, Rooney refuses to give up his son. He urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and raise him to be a better man than either of them are. Sullivan later ambushes and kills Rooney's bodyguards and then Rooney himself. Nitti reveals Connor's location after Sullivan promises that the feud will end with Connor's death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.\nSullivan takes Michael to his aunt's beach house in Perdition. Once there, he is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire, and Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire in the back. Michael tells his father that he could not pull the trigger, and Sullivan nods and smiles as he dies in his son's arms.\nMichael drives the car back to the elderly couple's farm. In a voiceover, he says that he grew up there. He adds that he has not held a gun since his father's death. Michael states that when he is asked if his father was a good man, he simply answers, \"He was my father\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nWhen Max Allan Collins wrote the graphic novel Road to Perdition, his book agent saw potential in the story as a film adaptation and showed it to a film agent. By 1999, the novel had reached Dean Zanuck, who was the vice president of development at the company owned by his father, producer Richard D. Zanuck. The novel was sent to the elder Zanuck in Morocco, who was there producing Rules of Engagement (2000). The Zanucks agreed on the story's prospect and sent it to director-producer Steven Spielberg. Shortly afterward, Spielberg set up the project at his studio DreamWorks, though he did not pursue direction of the film due to his full slate.\nSam Mendes sought a new project after completing American Beauty (1999) and explored prospects including A Beautiful Mind, K-PAX, The Shipping News, and The Lookout. DreamWorks sent Mendes Road to Perdition as a prospect, and Mendes was attracted to the story, considering it \"narratively very simple, but thematically very complex\". He specified one theme being the parents' world is inaccessible to their children. Mendes considered the story's theme to be about how children deal with violence, and whether exposure to violence would render children violent themselves. Mendes described the script as having \"no moral absolutes\", a factor that appealed to the director.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nSpielberg first contacted screenwriter David Self to adapt the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel but leaving the core elements of the story intact. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but this element was ultimately absent from the final version.\nThe story is deeply informed by the Lone Wolf and Cub manga series. Novelist Max Allan Collins acknowledged the influence of Lone Wolf and Cub on his graphic novel Road to Perdition in an interview to the BBC, declaring that \"Road To Perdition is 'an unabashed homage' to Lone Wolf and Cub\".\nSome characters' names were slightly changed from their original versions from the graphic novel: the surname of the real-life gangsters John Looney and his son Connor were changed to Rooney, and the surname of Tom Hanks' character and his family was streamlined from the original O'Sullivan to simply Sullivan. One significant addition to the script was the creation of Maguire to provide a persistent element of pursuit to the Sullivans' departure from the old world.\nHanks and cinematographer Conrad Hall requested Mendes to limit violence in the film to meaningful acts, rather than gratuitous carnage. Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan, is known as \"The Angel of Death\" in the graphic novel and invokes fear in those around him, but his infamy is downplayed in the film. Mendes, who described the graphic novel as \"much more pulpy\", sought to reduce the graphic novel's background to its essence, seeking the \"nonverbal simplicity\" of films like Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), and films by Akira Kurosawa that lack dialogue. Duplicate language in characters' confrontations in Road to Perdition was trimmed to the absolute minimum. Mendes described Road to Perdition as a \"poetic, elegiac story, in which the pictures tell the true story\". An example of one such unspoken scene in the film was the piano duet between Rooney and Michael Sr., intended to convey their relationship without words. In the final 20 minutes of Road to Perdition, the script was written to have only six lines of dialogue.\nMax Allan Collins originally wanted to write the adapted screenplay, but was not given the opportunity. He chose to stay out of the scripting process out of respect for the different style of writing for a different medium, though he served as a consultant in the process. Collins praised the addition of Maguire and considered the minimalist use of dialogue to be appropriate. The author also applauded the film's version of Rooney as \"more overtly a father figure\" to Sullivan.\nCollins opposed the profanity in the script, as the vulgar language did not fit his vision of the 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nTom Hanks was sent a copy of the graphic novel by Steven Spielberg while he was filming Cast Away. Initially too busy to make sense of the story, he later received David Self's adapted screenplay, to which he became attached. Hanks, a father to four children, described Michael Sullivan's role, \"I just got this guy. If you're a man, and you've got offspring ... emotionally, it's devastating.\"\nTyler Hoechlin was chosen from over 2,000 candidates to portray Michael Sullivan's son. The actor was 13 years old at the time of filming. For scenes in which Hoechlin's character assisted his father as a getaway driver, Hoechlin was trained by a driving instructor.\nPaul Newman was unanimously the first choice for the role of John Rooney. The actor prepared by requesting Frank McCourt, the Irish-American author of Angela's Ashes, to record a tape of his voice.\nDavid Self, who created the Maguire character, explained, \"He gets so jaded from exposure to this world, he steps over the line from being the storyteller to being the story maker.\" To capture the \"seedy countenance\" of the character, Jude Law was given a sallow skin tone that reflected the wear from working in a darkroom. Law's teeth also received a lower gumline and had a rotted look. He was also given a weak, thinning hairline. Maguire's apartment also displays a collection of photographs of dead bodies, some of them actual police stills from the 1930s.\nStanley Tucci was selective about roles in gangster films, believing that Hollywood stereotyped Italian-Americans as gangsters. However, attracted by the prospect of working with Mendes, the actor accepted the role of Nitti, a real-life Mob boss from Chicago.\nAnthony LaPaglia was cast as Al Capone and filmed a single scene, which was omitted from the final cut, and can be found in the DVD's deleted scenes. Mendes believed that Capone was more menacing as an unseen presence. Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with Frida (2002).\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nMendes sought to produce a period film that would avoid clich\u00e9s in the gangster genre. He chose to film Road to Perdition on location in Chicago, IL including downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman, the Charles G. Dawes House in Evanston, Illinois, as well as the far west Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. General Jones Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses units of the Illinois National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of scaffoldings.\n\nMendes collaborated with costume designer Albert Wolsky, production designer Dennis Gassner, and cinematographer Conrad Hall to design the film's style. Wolsky designed costumes that were \"very controlled, with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes.\" Gassner built sets that could capture the cold look of the era. Mendes sought a muted palette for the film, having dark backgrounds and sets with dark, muted greens and grays. Mendes filmed Road to Perdition using the Super 35 format.\nThe director filmed exterior scenes in Illinois in the winter and the spring of 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes. Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner's exterior locations to define the characters' emotional states. Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film. Filming concluded in June 2001.\n\n\n=== Cinematography ===\n To establish the lighting of scenes in Road to Perdition, Mendes drew from the paintings of Edward Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly Hopper's New York Movie (1939). Mendes and cinematographer Conrad Hall sought to convey similar atmospheric lighting for the film's scenes, applying a \"less is more\" mantra. Hall also shot at wide apertures that retained one point in the depth of field sharply focused. Hall considered the technique to provide an emotional dimension to the scenes. The cinematographer also used unconventional techniques and materials to create unique lighting effects. One of Hall's methods was to use black silk in daylight exterior scenes to filter the light enough to create an in-shade look.\nHall purposely distanced the camera from Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan Sr., at the beginning of the film to establish the perspective of Sullivan's son, who is unaware of his father's true nature. Hanks's character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows. A wide lens was used to maintain a distance from the character.\nShots in the film were drawn directly from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. An instance of the direct influence is the scene in which Michael Jr. looks up at the Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle's glass.\nA seamless 40-second driving scene, in which Michael Sullivan and his son travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of the scene was filmed at LaSalle Street, and due to the lack of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\n\n=== Consequences of violence ===\n\nThe film's title, Road to Perdition, is both Michael Sullivan and his son's destination town and a euphemism for Hell, a road that Sullivan desires to prevent his son from traveling. Sullivan, who chooses his violent path early on in life, considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate. Said Mendes, \"[Sullivan] is in a battle for the soul of his son. Can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child?\" Hanks described Sullivan as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means, whose likely repercussions he ignored. Sullivan is a good father and husband, but also has a job that requires him to be a violent killer. The film explores this paradoxical dichotomy. When Sullivan is faced with the consequences, Hanks says, \"At the moment we're dropped into the story, it is literally the last day of that false perspective.\" To keep Sullivan from justifying his violent actions in the film, Mendes omitted scenes in the final cut that had Sullivan explaining his background to his son.\nIn the film, most of the numerous acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed of violence in the real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.\n\n\n=== Fathers and sons ===\nThe film also explores father-son relationships between Michael Sullivan and his son, Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and his son Connor. Sullivan simultaneously idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son feels the same about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.\nBecause Sullivan shields his background from his son, his attempt to preserve the father-son relationship is actually harmful. Tragedy brings Sullivan and his son together. Sullivan escapes from the old world with his son, and the boy finds an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with his father. Tyler Hoechlin, who portrayed Michael Jr., explained, \"His dad starts to realize that Michael is all he has now and how much he's been missing. I think the journey is of a father and son getting to know each other, and also finding out who they themselves are.\"\n\n\n=== Rain ===\nRain served as a motif in the film. It was developed after researching the wake scene at the beginning of the film informed the director that corpses were kept on ice in the 1930s to keep bodies from decomposing. The notion was interwoven into the film, which linked the presence of rain with death. Mendes reflected on the theme, \"The linking of rain with death ... speaks of the mutability of rain and links to the uncontrollability of fate. These are things that humans can't control.\"\n\n\n== Release ==\nWith filming concluding in June 2001, the studio intended a United States release for the following Christmas. However, in September 2001, Mendes requested more time. It was rescheduled for release on July 12, 2002, an unconventional move that placed the drama among the action-oriented summer films.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nMax Allan Collins, who authored the graphic novel, was hired to write the novelization for the film adaptation. Collins initially turned in a draft that contained 90,000 words, but the licensing at DreamWorks required the author to use only the dialogue from the film and no additional dialogue. Collins reluctantly edited the novelization down to 50,000 words and later said he regretted taking on the task. In 2016, Brash Books published Collins' original version of the novelization as Road to Perdition: The New, Expanded Edition.\nRoad to Perdition was released on DVD on February 25, 2003, in both full screen and anamorphic widescreen versions. The DVD's features included an audio commentary, deleted scenes, an HBO \"Making of\" documentary, and a photo gallery. Work on the DVD began on the same day the film's production began, and a collaborative effort among the director, the studio, and the DVD production crew shaped the DVD's content. Due to a limit of space on the DVD, the film's deleted scenes were chosen over a DTS soundtrack. Instead, the DVD included a Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. A special edition DVD containing both DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks was also released, excluding the \"Making of\" documentary to fit both soundtracks.\nRoad to Perdition was released on Blu-ray Disc on August 3, 2010, featuring a widescreen transfer, a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, and all of the features from the DVD release.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nRoad to Perdition opened in 1,798 theaters in its debut weekend, competing against several other new releases including Reign of Fire, Halloween: Resurrection and The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course. It ended up grossing $22.1 million, placing second to holdover Men in Black II. The film then beat Men in Black and Stuart Little 2 to reach the number one spot during its second weekend with $15.4 million. It eventually grossed $104.5 million in the United States and $76.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $181 million.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nRoad to Perdition received positive reviews from critics, with Conrad L. Hall's cinematography, the production design, and the lead performances of Hanks and Newman being praised. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 81% based on 216 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Somber, stately, and beautifully mounted, Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition is a well-crafted mob movie that explores the ties between fathers and sons.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hall's cinematography and the thematic use of water. He, too, felt an emotional detachment from the characters, saying, \"I knew I admired it, but I didn't know if I liked it ... It is cold and holds us outside.\"\nKirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Hanks, Newman, and Craig but called Law's performance \"almost cartoonish\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also complimented Hanks and Newman: \"[They] act together with the confidence of titans, their talents in the service of character, never star ego.\" Travers cited Hall's \"breathtaking\" cinematography and composer Thomas Newman's \"evocative\" score.\nPaul Clinton of CNN said: \"While these deeply human issues are touched upon, they're never fully explored, and that undermines the sense of greatness to which this movie obviously aspires.\" Clinton considered Craig's character \"one-dimensional to the extreme\". He found the cinematography too overpowering for the film's storyline, which he considered \"weak\". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice described the film as \"grim yet soppy\". He added: \"The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed.\" Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post thought that the script lost its path when Sullivan and his son fled their old life.\nEleanor Ringel Gillespie of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution enjoyed the film's cinematography and Depression-era setting, as well as the performances of Hanks and Newman. Gillespie expressed the wish that the film lasted a little longer to explore its emotional core further. Eric Harrison of the Houston Chronicle considered Road to Perdition \"the most brilliant work in this [gangster] genre\" since the uncut Once Upon a Time in America (1984). Harrison considered Self's script \"so finely honed that the story can change directions in a heartbeat.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\nIn April 2006, Empire recognized Road to Perdition as No. 6 on its list of the top 20 comic book films.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nOxoby, Marc (2002). \"Road To Perdition (Mendes 2002)\".

            "Steel is a 1997 American superhero film loosely based on the DC Comics character of the same name. The film stars Shaquille O'Neal as John Henry Irons and his alter-ego Steel, Annabeth Gish as his wheelchair-using partner Susan Sparks, and Judd Nelson as their rival Nathaniel Burke. The plot centers on an accident caused by Burke which leaves Sparks paralyzed. The accident results in Irons quitting his job. Burke begins mass-producing weapons and selling them to criminals. In order to stop Burke, Irons and Sparks create a suit of armor that leads Irons to become the superhero Steel.\nWritten and directed by Kenneth Johnson, the film separates itself from the comic book series (and John Henry Irons' status as a supporting character of Superman) by using original protagonists and antagonists. Upon its initial release, Steel was a box-office bomb and was panned by critics, who complained about the film's \"cheesiness\" and poor acting.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nJohn Henry Irons is a weapons designer who invents high-tech laser guns, protective armor, and sonic sound cannons for the United States military. One soldier, Nathaniel Burke, decides to show just what Irons' weapons can do and sets one of Irons' sonic cannons at the highest power setting, firing the device at an abandoned building. However, the weapon backfires and destroys the building the team is situated in. Irons' partner, Susan \"Sparky\" Sparks, is crushed by a large slab of concrete in the ensuing chaos. In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a video arcade manager to help him carry out this deed.\nIrons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals. With the help of Uncle Joe, they forge a suit of armor and the weaponry necessary for Irons to carry out his war on crime and become the vigilante \"Steel\". However, during his crusade against crime, Irons is pursued by the cops and is forced to return to his lair. Five nights later, the robbers arrange to rob another bank. Irons, as Steel, tries to stop them, but is hindered by the robbers' weapons. When Irons returns to his grandmother's house, he is arrested.\nMeanwhile, Burke prepares to auction off all his modified weapons to every criminal organization in the world over the Internet. When Irons is released from jail, Sparky is captured by Burke's thugs. Irons, as Steel, attempts to infiltrate Burke's headquarters, but is captured himself in the process. When Burke continues with the auction, he is tricked by Steel, which allows him and Sparks to rebel and destroy Burke's lair. Burke himself is killed when a laser he fires towards Steel reflects back towards him due to Steel's suit. After this, Steel, Sparky, Joe, and Martin escape Burke's lair.\nThe following day, Col. David talks to actor Arnold Schwarzenegger (actually Irons via voice changer) about Steel and the events on what happened the day before and offers him to help before realising it is actually Irons who he is talking to and after that, Irons declines David's offer.\nIn the grand opening of her restaurant, Irons' grandmother tells him about Steel and then tells Joe that everyone would be proud of his heroism. After Sparky shows the new modifications of her wheelchair that allows her to walk, Irons smiles and hugs her.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nProduction of the film Steel started with music producer Quincy Jones and his partner David Salzman. Both Jones and Salzman were fans of the Steel character, especially Jones, who found personal reasons to support the project. Jones stated that he found children's \"perspective on the future has changed for the worse, and I hate seeing young people who don't believe in the future. Steel\u2014and I don't want to use that word 'superhero' because he doesn't fly or anything like that\u2014represents a role model. Let's just call him a 'super human being'\". Wesley Snipes was Kenneth Johnson's first choice for the lead role. Jones and Salzman had initially approached Shaquille O'Neal and his agent Leonard Armato regarding a Hardware adaptation, but the basketballer said he related himself more to Steel. Johnson later admitted that Shaq was a bad choice for the role.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nKenneth Johnson was the screenwriter and director of Steel. Johnson was originally uninterested in doing a superhero film, having previously turned down similar projects after the success of his television series The Bionic Woman, Alien Nation, and The Incredible Hulk. Film producer Joel Simon described Steel as being different, stating that he was \"a knight in shining armor in a contemporary setting\". Johnson removed Steel's cape from his costume to reflect this.\nJohnson described Steel's persona as a \"blue-collar Batman\" and removed Steel from his comic book storyline and replaced it with protagonists and antagonists of his own invention. To aid with the urban aspects of the dialog Johnson took a copy of the script to South Central Los Angeles and spent a day with a group of kids to ensure that the language of some of the characters was more believable. Throughout the film and script, Johnson created several allusions to his previous television series Alien Nation.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe filming schedule consisted of fifty-one days with thirty-two full nights of shooting in downtown Los Angeles. The shooting schedule presented difficulties for the director due to the schedule of the star Shaquille O'Neal. O'Neal was already committed for playing in the 1996 Summer Olympics, and training at the Los Angeles Lakers' camp in Hawaii. This left Johnson with five weeks to complete filming all scenes with O'Neal. O'Neal had one read-through of the script before the Olympics and then worked with acting coach Ben Martin in between games to work on his character. When O'Neal returned to act with the rest of the cast, he had all his lines memorized.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nAs well as acting in the film, Shaquille O'Neal contributed to the soundtrack for the film. The single \"Men of Steel\" has him featured alongside rappers KRS-One, Ice Cube, B-Real, and Peter Gunz. The soundtrack was released on Quincy Jones' record label Qwest Records and included songs featured in the film and songs inspired by it. The album charted in the United States on the Billboard 200 at number 185 and on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums at number 26.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nSteel was released in the United States on August 15, 1997, making only $870,068 across 1,260 theaters on its opening weekend. With a second weekend decline of 78%, it achieved the record for having the biggest sophomore weekend drop for any superhero film, being tied with The Marvels. The film bombed at the box office, earning just $1.7 million domestically with an estimated budget of $16 million.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nSteel was critically panned upon its original release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 8%, based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Steel is a badly-acted movie that indulges not only in superhero clich\u00e9s, but also the sappy TV-movie-of-the-week ones\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 28% based on reviews from 12 critics, indiciating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nLeonard Kladly of Variety wrote that the film is \"too broad and episodic to attract anything other than the most undemanding crowd\". Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as a \"tolerable stinker of a film\" that \"plays like a Saturday morning cartoon\". Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times stated that the film is \"slow to gather momentum and generates little excitement or tension\". Shaquille O'Neal earned a Razzie Award nomination as Worst Actor for his performance in the film, but lost against Kevin Costner for The Postman.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSteel at AllMovie\nSteel at Box Office Mojo\nSteel at IMDb",
            "Supergirl is a 1984 superhero film directed by Jeannot Szwarc from a screenplay by David Odell based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is the fourth film in the Superman film series, set after the events of Superman III (1983) and serving as a spin-off of the series. The film stars Helen Slater as Supergirl, along with Faye Dunaway, Hart Bochner, Peter Cook, Mia Farrow, Brenda Vaccaro, and Peter O'Toole, with Marc McClure reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen from the Superman films.\nThe film was released in the United Kingdom on 19 July 1984 and in the United States on 21 November 1984, but failed to impress either critics or audiences, while also underperforming at the box-office. Dunaway and O'Toole earned Golden Raspberry Award nominations for Worst Actress and Worst Actor, respectively. Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress. The film's failure ultimately led producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind to sell the Superman film rights to The Cannon Group, Inc. in 1986.\nIts first DVD release was by the independent home video company Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2000, under license from then-rights holder StudioCanal. Warner Bros. Pictures acquired the rights to the film and reissued it on DVD late in 2006 to coincide with the release of Superman Returns. Although it is canon with the Christopher Reeve Superman films, it is not included in any of the Superman DVD or Blu-ray box sets by Warner Bros.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKara Zor-El, cousin of Kal-El, and Jor-El's niece, lives in Argo City, an isolated community that survived the planet Krypton's destruction by being transported into a pocket of trans-dimensional space, called the \"Innerspace.\" Zaltar, a wizard, has allowed Kara to observe a unique and immensely powerful item known as the \"Omegahedron,\" which he has borrowed without the knowledge of the city's government, and of which powers Argo. However, a mishap leads to the Omegahedron being rocketed into space. Taking a ship, Kara follows the Omegahedron to Earth, while undergoing a transformation into \"Supergirl\" in the process, to recover it and save Argo City.\nOn Earth, the Omegahedron is recovered by Selena, a power-hungry would-be witch assisted by the feckless Bianca, seeking to free herself from a relationship with warlock Nigel. Whilst not knowing exactly what it is, Selena quickly realizes the Omegahedron is powerful and can give her true magic. Kara arrives on Earth and is granted new powers by its environment and the radiation of its sun. While seeking the Omegahedron, she creates the cover identity \"Linda Lee\", cousin of Clark Kent, and enrolls at an all-girls school where she befriends Lucy Lane, the younger sister of Lois Lane who happens to be studying there. Kara also meets and becomes enamored with Ethan, a school groundskeeper.\nEthan also catches the eye of Selena, who drugs him with a love potion which will make him fall in love with the first person he sees for a day. Ethan regains consciousness in Selena's absence and wanders out into the streets. An angry Selena uses her new-found powers to animate a construction vehicle to retrieve Ethan, causing chaos as it does so. Supergirl, in the guise of Linda, rescues Ethan, and he falls in love with her instead.\nSupergirl and Selena proceed to battle. Selena captures Ethan, then traps Supergirl and sends her to the Phantom Zone, a prison dimension. Now powerless, Supergirl wanders the bleak landscape and nearly drowns in an oily bog. Eventually, she encounters Zaltar, who has exiled himself to the Phantom Zone as a punishment for losing the Omegahedron. Zaltar helps Kara to escape, sacrificing his life to do so. Back on Earth, Selena uses the Omegahedron to make herself a \"princess of Earth\" with Ethan as her lover and consort.\nEmerging from the Phantom Zone through a mirror, Supergirl regains her powers and confronts Selena, who uses the Omegahedron to summon a gigantic shadow demon. The demon is on the verge of defeating Supergirl when she hears Zaltar's voice urging her to fight on. Supergirl breaks free and Nigel tells her the only way to defeat Selena is to turn the demon against her. Supergirl complies and creates a focused whirlwind that traps Selena, who is then attacked and incapacitated by the demon as the whirlwind pulls in Bianca as well. The three are sucked through the mirror portal, which promptly reforms, trapping them all forever. Free from Selena's spell, Ethan admits his love for Linda, knowing she and Supergirl are one and the same. He also understands she must save Argo City and that he may not see her again. Kara returns the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which then lights up again.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nHelen Slater as Kara Zor-El / Linda Lee / Supergirl\nFaye Dunaway as Selena\nPeter O'Toole as Zaltar\nHart Bochner as Ethan\nMia Farrow as Alura In-Ze\nBrenda Vaccaro as Bianca\nPeter Cook as Nigel\nSimon Ward as Zor-El\nMarc McClure as Jimmy Olsen\nMaureen Teefy as Lucy Lane\nDavid Healy as Mr. Danvers\nSandra Dickinson as Pretty Young Lady\nMatt Frewer as Eddie, The Truck Driver\nKelly Hunter as Argonian Citizen\nGlory Annen as Midvale Protester\nBradley Lavelle as Lucy's Friend\n\n\n=== Cast notes ===\nChristopher Reeve was slated to have a cameo as Superman, but bowed out early on. His non-appearance in the film is explained via a news broadcast (overheard by Selena) stating that Superman has left Earth on a \"peace-seeking mission\" to a distant galaxy. In the Superman documentary You Will Believe..., Director Jeannot Szwarc said Reeve's involvement in this film would have given the feature higher credibility, and admitted he wished Reeve had made a contribution to the film's production. A publicity photo of him as Superman does appear as a poster in Lucy and Linda's shared dorm room.\nMarc McClure makes his fourth of five appearances in the Superman-related films; he is the only actor to appear in all four films featuring Superman and this spin-off film. Demi Moore auditioned for and was cast as character Lucy Lane but bowed out to make the film Blame It on Rio. Maureen Teefy was signed instead.\n\n\n== Production ==\nUpon gaining the film rights for Superman: The Movie in the 1970s, Alexander Salkind and his son, Ilya, also purchased the rights to the character of Supergirl, should any sequel or spin-off occur. Supergirl was originally slated to debut in Superman III in a plot line intended to set up a standalone film, but her character was ultimately removed. The Salkinds announced the Supergirl film in April 1982, before production began on Superman III. After the critical  disappointment of that film, the Salkinds opted to use the Supergirl movie to freshen the franchise. Ilya later recounted, \"[It was] something different, to an extent. I thought it was a very different area to explore.\" Originally the plot was to center around Supergirl rescuing Superman, who would be portrayed as her cousin and mentor, but the film was heavily rewritten after Reeve chose not to be involved.\nThe producers attempted, and failed, to get the services of Richard Lester, who had directed Superman III and had completed the second film after their dismissal of original director Richard Donner. Robert Wise also turned down the director's chair. But French filmmaker Jeannot Szwarc, who was best known at that time for his work in television and for directing Jaws 2, was ultimately chosen after a meeting with Christopher Reeve, who had complimented the Somewhere in Time director. Szwarc sought advice from Donner over some technical aspects of the production.\nHundreds of actresses tested for the role of Supergirl/Linda, among them Demi Moore and Brooke Shields. Shields and Moore were both ultimately rejected by both Ilya and Szwarc, who had both wanted an unknown actress, and they instead signed Helen Slater, who was paid $75,000 in a three-picture deal. Slater had four months of physical training to prepare for the role. Additionally, Dolly Parton reportedly turned down the role of Selena before it was offered to Dunaway.\nPrincipal photography began at Pinewood Studios near London on April 18, 1983, and wrapped on August 11, 1983. Although the Salkinds financed the film completely on their own budget, Warner Bros. was still involved in the production since the studio owned the distribution rights to the film, and its parent company, Warner Communications, was also the parent company of DC Comics, owners of all \"Superman and Superman family\" copyrights. The entire film was shot, edited and overseen under the supervision of Warner Bros. and originally scheduled to be released in July 1984. However, the relationship between the studio and the partnership was strained after the critical and commercial underperformance of Superman III in June 1983, during the production of the film. The Salkinds insisted on moving the opening date from the summer to the holiday season in order to avoid competition with other major films and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The studio claimed it could not provide a holiday slot and relinquished its distribution rights of Supergirl to the Salkinds, who gave the distribution rights to Tri-Star Pictures. The film proceeded to be released overseas, however, and received a Royal Film Premiere in the United Kingdom in July 1.\n\n\n== Music ==\n\nThe film score for Supergirl was composed and conducted by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had been the initial interest of director Richard Donner to compose for the first Superman film. Goldsmith used a number of techniques to identify the music to the film, such as synthesizers simulating the sounds of take-off during the main theme. The soundtrack has been released twice, through Var\u00e8se Sarabande in 1985 and an extended version through Silva Screen in 1993. It has also been referred by critics as one of the only redeeming qualities of the movie.\n\"The Superman Poster\", included on the 1993 release, incorporates John Williams's Superman theme.\n1985 Var\u00e8se Sarabande Album\n\n\"Main Title\" (3:12)\n\"'Where Is She?'\" (1:05)\n\"Black Magic\" (4:06)\n\"First Flight\" (4:14)\n\"The Butterfly\" (1:34)\n\"'Where Is Linda?'\" (1:14)\n\"The Monster Tractor\" (7:26)\n\"The Bracelet\" (1:24)\n\"Monster Storm\" (2:55)\n\"A New School\" (2:08)\n\"The Flying Car\" (1:25)\n\"The Map\" (1:10)\n\"9M-3\" (1:41)\n\"End Title\" (6:05)\n1993 Silva Screen Album\n\n\"Overture\" (6:07)\n\"Main Title & Argo City\" (3:15)\n\"Argo City Mall\" (0:56)\n\"The Butterfly\" (1:36)\n\"The Journey Begins\" (1:12)\n\"Arrival on Earth/Flying Ballet\" (5:36)\n\"Chicago Lights/Street Attack\" (2:23)\n\"The Superman Poster\" (0:52)\n\"A New School\" (2:13)\n\"The Map\" (1:10)\n\"Ethan Spellbound\" (2:13)\n\"The Monster Tractor\" (7:34)\n\"Flying Ballet - Alternate Version\" (2:13)\n\"The Map - Alternate Version\" (1:13)\n\"The Bracelet\" (1:44)\n\"First Kiss/The Monster Storm\" (4:35)\n\"'Where Is She'/The Monster Bumper Cars\" (2:57)\n\"The Flying Bumper Car\" (1:28)\n\"'Where's Linda?'\" (1:21)\n\"Black Magic\" (4:08)\n\"The Phantom Zone\" (3:42)\n\"The Vortex/The End of Zaltar\" (5:49)\n\"The Final Showdown & Victory/End Title - Short Version\" (12:10)\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nInternational Video Entertainment paid $3.2 million for North American home video rights, one of the largest deals at the time, and released the Tri-Star-edited 105-minute U.S. version in 1985. The film has since been released several times on VHS, Betamax, laserdisc, and DVD. In 1990, the same 105-minute U.S. cut was re-released on VHS by Avid Home Entertainment. By the mid-1990s, the rights to the film were acquired by Pueblo Film Licensing (successor-in-interest to the Salkind production company) and French production company StudioCanal. By this time Anchor Bay Entertainment had assumed the video rights, where it was re-issued on VHS in 1998 as the \"114-minute cut\" under the Anchor Bay Entertainment Family Movies label. For their DVD release on August 8, 2000, two versions were issued. The first of these was a 2-disc \"Limited Edition\" set (limited to 50,000 copies only) featuring the 124-minute \"International Version\" (never seen in the United States, which was digitally mastered by THX for this DVD release), along with a 138-minute \"director's cut\", which had been discovered in StudioCanal's archives. The second version was a single-disc version featuring the 124-minute \"International Version\", with many bonus features: a 16-page full color booklet; Audio Commentary with Director Jeannot Szwarc and Special Project Consultant Scott Michael Bosco; \"The Making of Supergirl\" Featurette; U.S. & Foreign Theatrical Trailers; U.S. TV Spots; Original Storyboards; Still & Poster Galleries; and Talent Bios (these extra features were also available on the 2-disc \"Limited Edition\" set). Anchor Bay re-issued a new VHS release once again, this time the 124-minute \"International Version\" coinciding with the DVD release, both a separate fullscreen and widescreen editions (widescreen version labeled as the \"Collector's Edition\") under different packaging artwork and digitally mastered by THX. The \"Director's Cut\" DVD was made from the last print known to exist of the cut, which was apparently prepared for possible television broadcast before the film was edited into its various versions. This longer version was never broadcast on network television in the United States, though it is believed to have been distributed in syndication worldwide.\nIn 2002, Anchor Bay re-issued the 138 minute \"Director's Cut\" separately. In November 2006, coinciding with the home video release of Superman Returns, Warner Home Video, now owning the rights to the film through their parent company Warner Bros., released a single-disc DVD featuring the 124-minute \"International Version\" cut of the film, with only some extra material being carried over from the former out-of-print Anchor Bay releases, a commentary by director Jeannot Szwarc and Special Project Consultant Scott Bosco, and the theatrical trailer. This Warner Bros. release includes an edited version of the audio commentary from the Anchor Bay release. All comments about Anchor Bay are edited out.\nIt was reissued on 17 July 2018, under the Warner Archive Collection label as a two\u2013disc set, with the International Cut on Blu-ray (in a new 1080p HD remaster), and the \"Director's Cut\" on DVD, mastered in SD as the only surviving element of the longer version is from the same StudioCanal print used for the previous Anchor Bay release. The commentary from the 2000 video release, \"The Making of Supergirl\" Featurette, and a theatrical trailer were carried over to WAC's latest issue.\n\n\n=== Deleted material ===\n\nMaterial that was cut for the 105-minute version of the film included the Argo City opening, which was originally longer.\nAnother cut scene from the US release is known as the \"flying ballet\", though included in the International Cut. As Supergirl arrives on Earth, she is surprised to find herself capable of almost anything, especially flying. She can use her super-strength to crack rocks into dust, and use her heat-ray vision to help flowers grow.\nScenes concerning Selena, Bianca, and Nigel were also trimmed. In the U.S. version, Selena's introduction was merely a few lines long when the Omegahedron lands on Earth, and Selena takes it for use of its magic. The full introduction establishes Selena as an impatient witch, who is sick of her mentor and lover, Nigel, who is himself, a warlock. Later scenes not seen before the 2000 DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment, include Selena using the Omegahedron for the first time, and realizing that she has no control of herself when under its influence, namely the \"Roast Chicken\" sequence. Selena later throws a party for all her followers, and deleted material shows Nigel insulting Selena after being dismissed. Nigel then gets friendly with another party member, on whom Selena pulls a vicious magical prank.\nOther scenes involve Linda Lee making a temporary home in the city of Midvale, Illinois, and an extended version of the tractor sequence in which the possessed machine runs amok on the Midvale streets and kills a civilian. This alleged death scene does not appear in either the International or the 2000 Director's Cut. Another cut scene shows Supergirl unable to find the Omegahedron because Selena keeps it in a lead box, demonstrating that Supergirl's limitations are similar to those of her cousin. The Phantom Zone scenes are also longer.\nThe 2006 DVD release and current Blu-Ray reissue by Warner Home Video, whose parent company, Warner Bros., is the current rights holder to the Superman movies, contains the International Edition, also called the \"European Theatrical Edition\". The latter release also features the aforementioned \"director's cut\".\nMuch of the deleted material appeared in DC Comics's one-shot comic book adaptation of the film, primarily the scenes that fleshed out Selena's character.\n\n\n==== Broadcast television version ====\nThe American theatrical cut for Supergirl ran at 105 minutes. Supergirl originally ran at 124 minutes in its European version. When it aired on network television in 1987, ABC added numerous scenes from the International theatrical version as well as sequences not contained in any other edit. Shown in a two-hour slot, this 92-minute version was essentially a cut-down version of the \"Director's Cut\", otherwise resembling the U.S. edit, with \"offensive\" dialogue dubbed over for TV. This same 92-minute version was also seen in syndication on most stations (as well as superstations such as TBS and WGN) by Viacom.\nSome broadcast television versions have a scene not seen in either laserdisc edition: After Selena's defeat, Nigel is standing on the street. He bends over to pick up the Coffer of Shadows, now restored to its original, small size and decides to keep it as a memento. In another broadcast-only scene, after Supergirl flies off to return to Argo City, Ethan gets into his truck. He then stops to say goodbye to Lucy and Jimmy. Both scenes can be found in the director's cut.\nAs aforementioned, the full longer version has never been broadcast on U.S. network television.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nIn the United States, Supergirl was picked up by Tri-Star Pictures for release on 21 November 1984. Test audiences found the film overlong and the film was edited from 135 minutes to 105 minutes for its North American release. Critical reviews in the United States were poor, and although the film took the #1 slot at the North American box-office during its opening weekend, it is widely considered to be a box office bomb after making only $14.3 million in North America.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nSupergirl holds an approval rating of 8% and has an average rating of 3.4/10 on Rotten Tomatoes based on 36 reviews. Many of the reviews were harshly negative, with Dunaway's exceedingly campy performance especially reviled. The consensus reads: \"The effects are cheesy and Supergirl's wide-eyed, cheery heroine simply isn't interesting to watch for an hour and a half.\" On Metacritic the film has a rating of 41 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\" from 13 professional reviewers. Variety referred to the film as \"intermittently enjoyable spectacle\" and described \"some well-staged effects highlights, notably a violent storm that threatens the school and the climax which Supergirl and Selena confront each other in the latter's mountain-top castle.\"\nBoth Rita Kempley and Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post gave it positive marks. John Grant, writing in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, was more positive about the film, describing Slater as \"an exceptionally charming Supergirl\" and wrote that Supergirl had some \"excellent\u2014and excellently realised\u2014flights of imagination.\" Grant criticised the \"inconsistent\" characterization of Slater and Dunaway's characters. In conclusion, he stated while Supergirl \"was less than the sum of its parts, not all of those parts are insignificant.\"\nColin Greenland reviewed Supergirl for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"I may be old-fashioned, but I can't help wishing today's film-makers thought it worthwhile including a little logic In their fantasies, instead of having characters whose motivations, abilities and weaknesses change all the time, with no explanation whatever. A fun film, in a vacuous sort of way.\" \nJanet Maslin of The New York Times expressed \"some initial curiosity\" about the differences between Superman and Supergirl, but that the film \"quickly loses its novelty.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nThe film was nominated for two Razzie Awards, including Worst Actor for Peter O'Toole and Worst Actress for Faye Dunaway. Helen Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress.\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\nYears after her single appearance as Supergirl, Helen Slater took on the recurring role of Lara, biological mother of Clark Kent, on the TV series Smallville (2001-2011), and later played the recurring character of Eliza Danvers, the adopted mother of the titular character in the TV series Supergirl (2015-2021). A CGI version of the character makes a cameo in the 2023 DC Studios film The Flash, alongside a CGI version of Christopher Reeve's Superman.\n\n\n== Novelization ==\nA novelization was written by Norma Fox Mazer and released in paperback form in 1984.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSupergirl at IMDb\nSupergirl at AllMovie\nSupergirl at the TCM Movie Database\nSupergirl at Box Office Mojo\nSUPERGIRL the Movie at Supergirl: Maid of Might\nSuperman Homepage: Supergirl \u2013 Movie Synopsis/Review/Critique\nThe Superman Super Site - Super Girl",
            "Superman is an upcoming American superhero film based on DC Comics featuring the eponymous character. Produced by DC Studios and to be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it will be the first film in the DC Universe (DCU) and a reboot of the Superman film series. The film is written and directed by James Gunn and stars David Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman, alongside Rachel Brosnahan, Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi, Nathan Fillion, Anthony Carrigan, Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda, Sara Sampaio, Skyler Gisondo, Nicholas Hoult, Terence Rosemore, Wendell Pierce, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Neva Howell, Beck Bennett, Mikaela Hoover, and Christopher McDonald. In the film, Superman's journey to reconcile his alien heritage with his human family is explored.\nDevelopment on a sequel to the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film Man of Steel (2013) began by October 2014, with Henry Cavill set to reprise his role as Superman. Plans changed after the troubled production of Justice League (2017) and the Man of Steel sequel was no longer moving forward by May 2020. Gunn began work on a new Superman film around August 2022. In October, he became co-CEO of DC Studios with producer Peter Safran and they began work on a new DC Universe. Gunn was revealed to be writing the film in December. The title Superman: Legacy was announced the next month, Gunn was confirmed to be directing in March 2023, and Corenswet and Brosnahan were cast that June. The subtitle was dropped by the end of February 2024, when filming began in Norway. Production primarily took place at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with location filming around Georgia and Ohio. Filming wrapped in July. The film takes inspiration from the comic book All-Star Superman (2005\u20132008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, among others.\nSuperman is scheduled to be released theatrically in the United States on July 11, 2025. It is set to be the first film of the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe film explores Clark Kent / Superman's journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his adoptive human family in Smallville, Kansas.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nDavid Corenswet as Clark Kent / Superman:A Kryptonian survivor and a young journalist for the Daily Planet in Metropolis. Director James Gunn said the film's version of Superman would be around 25 years old, making him more established than Tom Welling's version from the series Smallville (2001\u20132011) but younger than Henry Cavill's DC Extended Universe (DCEU) version. Producer Peter Safran described the film's version of Superman as \"the embodiment of truth, justice and the American way; he's kindness in a world that thinks of kindness as old fashioned\".\nRachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane: A reporter for the Daily Planet and a close colleague of Clark. Brosnahan described Lois as \"fiercely intelligent\" and feisty.\nIsabela Merced as Hawkgirl:A superhero with wings and various melee weapons. Merced's short 5 feet 1 inch (1.55 m) height differentiates her from other DCU heroes. Merced felt that her role as Anya Corazon in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film Madame Web (2024) helped prepare her to play Hawkgirl, though she did not tell the Superman filmmakers about that role in case they did not want her to play both.\nEdi Gathegi as Michael Holt / Mister Terrific: A superhero and inventor\nNathan Fillion as Guy Gardner / Green Lantern:An abrasive galactic peacekeeper in the Green Lantern Corps. The film retains the character's \"iconic bowl cut haircut\" from the comics. Fillion previously portrayed Cory Pitzner / T.D.K. (The Detachable Kid) in Gunn's DCEU film The Suicide Squad (2021).\nAnthony Carrigan as Rex Mason / Metamorpho:An archaeologist and superhero who can \"transmute elements in his body into various forms\". Carrigan said it was refreshing to play a superhero after previously portraying the Batman villain Victor Zsasz in the television series Gotham (2014\u20132019). He felt that he could bring some \"authenticity and truth\" to the role by comparing Metamorpho's concerns about his abilities to Carrigan's own alopecia.\nMar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda as Angela Spica / The Engineer: A member of the Authority whose abilities come from nanotechnology built in her body\nSara Sampaio as Eve Teschmacher: Lex Luthor's assistant and love interest\nSkyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen: A boyish young photographer for the Daily Planet and a colleague of Clark\nNicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor:A businessman and the arch-nemesis of Superman. Hoult was inspired by Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal of Lex Luthor in the series Smallville, and chose to work out for the role based on the depiction of Luthor in the comic book All-Star Superman (2005\u20132008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely. Gunn took inspiration for the character from Brian Azzarello's limited comic book series Lex Luthor: Man of Steel (2005) as well as Jerry Siegel's \"reckless scientific genius\" version of Luthor in comic books from the 1950s and 1960s.\nTerence Rosemore as Otis: Luthor's henchman\nWendell Pierce as Perry White: The editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet. Pierce asked his friends for information on the character because he did not read comic books growing up.\nPruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan Kent: Clark's adoptive human father\nNeva Howell as Martha Kent: Clark's adoptive human mother\nBeck Bennett as Steve Lombard: A Daily Planet reporter\nMikaela Hoover as Cat Grant: A Daily Planet columnist\nChristopher McDonald as Ron Troupe: A Daily Planet reporter\nAdditionally, Frank Grillo reprises his role as Rick Flag Sr. from the animated DCU series Creature Commandos (2024). Gunn's brother Sean is expected to appear as the businessman Maxwell Lord, as is Milly Alcock as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El / Supergirl. Sean Gunn said they ignored past depictions of Lord when creating their version, including Peter Facinelli's portrayal in the Arrowverse series Supergirl (2015\u20132021) and Pedro Pascal's in the DCEU film Wonder Woman 1984 (2020). ABC News correspondent Will Reeve, the son of former Superman actor Christopher Reeve, is set to make a cameo appearance in the film as a news reporter. Alan Tudyk has been cast in an undisclosed role. Clark's superpowered dog Krypto, who Gunn described as a \"not-so-good-good-boy\", also appears in the film.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nWarner Bros. Pictures was planning in 2012 for the film Man of Steel (2013), based on the DC Comics character Superman, to start a shared universe, which became known as the \"DC Extended Universe\" (DCEU). They announced a full slate of DC films in October 2014, prioritizing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) as the second DCEU film after Man of Steel failed to meet the studio's financial expectations. Despite this, they said an undated sequel to Man of Steel was in development with Henry Cavill set to reprise his role as Clark Kent / Superman. Man of Steel director Zack Snyder said they had been considering the imprisoned Kryptonians from the first film and the character Brainiac as antagonists for the sequel before work began on Batman v Superman. A Man of Steel sequel was in active development as a top priority for the studio in August 2016, which Cavill's manager Dany Garcia confirmed the following month. Amy Adams, who portrayed Lois Lane in Man of Steel, said in November that the studio was working on the screenplay. Matthew Vaughn was Warner Bros.' top choice to direct the film and had preliminary conversations about it by March 2017. Vaughn and comic book writer Mark Millar had previously pitched a new Superman trilogy prior to the development of Man of Steel, in which the destruction of the planet Krypton would not occur until after Superman had already grown-up on the planet. After the troubled production of the DCEU film Justice League (2017), Warner Bros. re-thought its approach to DC projects. By the end of 2017, a Man of Steel sequel was not coming \"anytime soon, if at all\". Justice League producer Charles Roven said story ideas had been discussed but there was no script.\nBefore the release of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout in July 2018, director Christopher McQuarrie and co-star Cavill pitched their take on a new Superman film, but Warner Bros. did not pursue the idea. Later in 2018, the studio asked James Gunn to write and direct a Superman film, but he was uncertain if he wanted to take on the character. He did not have a clear vision for such a film, especially since Superman was a well-known character unlike the Guardians of the Galaxy who he had adapted for Marvel Studios in the film Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). Gunn chose to make The Suicide Squad (2021) instead. In September, negotiations for Cavill to reprise his role for a cameo appearance in Shazam! (2019) ended due to contract issues, as well as a scheduling conflict with Cavill's Fallout commitments. The actor was reported to be parting ways with the studio, with no plans for him to reprise his role in future projects, but Cavill said in November 2019 that he had not given up on the character and still wanted to do the role justice. At that time, Warner Bros. was unsure which direction to take the character and was talking to \"high-profile talent\" about the property, including J. J. Abrams\u2014whose company Bad Robot signed an overall deal with Warner Bros.' parent company WarnerMedia\u2014and Michael B. Jordan, who pitched himself as a Black version of the character. By May 2020, Warner Bros. was no longer developing a Man of Steel sequel, but Cavill was in talks to appear in a different future DC film. In February 2021, Ta-Nehisi Coates was revealed to be writing a new Superman film that Abrams was producing. The film was expected to feature a Black actor portraying Superman, with the potential for Jordan to take on the role.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn April 2022, Discovery, Inc. and WarnerMedia merged to become Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), led by president and CEO David Zaslav. The new company was expected to restructure DC Entertainment and Zaslav began searching for an equivalent to Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige to lead the new subsidiary. Zaslav and WBD felt DC lacked a \"coherent creative and brand strategy\" and were underusing Superman. James Gunn was hired around late August to work on a Superman film that was not a sequel to Man of Steel and would be standalone from the DCEU. Zaslav spent time with Gunn while he was writing the script. In October, Cavill made a cameo appearance in the post-credits scene of the DCEU film Black Adam (2022) and Warner Bros. was reportedly pursuing a Cavill-led Man of Steel sequel once again. Roven was producing and the studio was searching for writers. They wanted McQuarrie to direct, but he was unlikely to be available due to his commitments to Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One (2023) and an untitled eighth Mission: Impossible film (2025). Abrams's and Coates's film was still in development. Cavill's role in Black Adam was approved by Warner Bros. film chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy when they were approached directly by Black Adam star Dwayne Johnson. Johnson began promoting the idea of a Black Adam vs. Superman film co-starring Cavill. The latter had signed a one-off deal for Black Adam and only received a verbal agreement that he would continue playing the character in the DCEU. Cavill publicly announced that he would return as Superman for future projects, and said his Black Adam cameo was a \"very small taste\" of future plans. He said Superman would be \"enormously joyful\" moving forward. Steven Knight wrote a script treatment for the sequel around that time, which reportedly included Brainiac as the antagonist, but Warner Bros. executives were not thrilled with his take.\n\nJames Gunn and The Suicide Squad producer Peter Safran were announced as the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios at the end of October 2022. A week after starting their new roles, the pair had begun developing an eight-to-ten-year plan for a new DC Universe (DCU) that would be a \"soft reboot\" of the DCEU. In mid-November, Gunn was publicly revealed to be writing a new DC film. Andy Muschietti, director of the DCEU film The Flash (2023), expressed interest in directing a Superman project with a similar tone to Richard Donner's Superman (1978). In early November, Cavill expressed interest in a future project that explored Superman's \"capacity to give and to love\" the people of Earth and to inspire others, and said he was looking forward to meeting with Gunn to discuss future opportunities. Work on the Man of Steel sequel stalled later that month while Gunn and Safran were developing their plans.\nIn December 2022, Gunn said Superman was a big priority, if not the biggest, for DC Studios, before publicly announcing that he was writing a new Superman film that would focus on a younger version of the character and would therefore not star Cavill. There was potential for Gunn to also direct the film. It would not be an origin story for Superman, and would focus on him as a young reporter interacting with key characters, such as Lois Lane. Gunn and Safran met with Cavill to explain their decision and discuss potentially working with him for a different role in the future. On January 31, 2023, Gunn and Safran unveiled the first projects from their DCU slate, which begins with Chapter One: Gods and Monsters. Their Superman film was the first film in that chapter and was officially titled Superman: Legacy. It was given a release date of July 11, 2025. Safran wanted Gunn to direct the film. Gunn said the film would take specific inspiration from the comic book All-Star Superman (2005\u20132008) by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, and the next day that comic appeared on Amazon's list of best-selling comic books. The film was also inspired by the animated Superman short films from Fleischer Studios (1941\u20131943), and by these comic books: the Superman: Birthright (2003\u201304) limited series by Mark Waid, Leinil Francis Yu, and Gerry Alanguilan; the 2008 \"Brainiac\" story arc from Action Comics by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank; the crossover event Superman: Ending Battle (2002) by Johns, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Mark Schultz; the Superman for All Seasons (1998) limited series by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale; the Elseworlds limited series Kingdom Come (1996) by Waid and Alex Ross; Morrison's Action Comics run; and the story \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" (1986) by Alan Moore and Curt Swan.\nTom King, a comic book writer working on the DCU, stated in March 2023 that Gunn was also directing the film, which Gunn confirmed later that month. At that time, Safran was confirmed to be producing the film. Gunn was hesitant to direct the film, despite encouragement from Safran and others, until he realized how focusing on Superman's heritage with his aristocratic Kryptonian parents and adoptive farmer parents from Smallville, Kansas, would inform the characterization. Gunn felt emotionally connected to this aspect of the film because of his late father, whose birthday was shared with the film's intended release date. Gunn said in April that the film's tone would differ from his Guardians of the Galaxy films, and he suggested that Superman's dog Krypto could appear.\n\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nProduction design, costume design, and the casting process began in April 2023. Beth Mickle and Judianna Makovsky returned in their respective roles as production designer and costume designer from The Suicide Squad and Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). Filming was set to begin in January 2024. Gunn was looking for an actor to play Superman who possessed the character's humanity, kindness, and compassion, and was \"somebody who you want to give a hug\". He said the character Jimmy Olsen would appear, and that he was not looking to make the film a comedy. He hoped Legacy would be different from previous Superman films while still respecting what came before. Gunn turned in the first draft of the script at the end of April and the production was not expected to be impacted by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike when it began in early May.\n\nAudition tapes for the main roles of Superman, Lois Lane, and Lex Luthor were submitted by early May 2023. Gunn began watching them later that month, while he was storyboarding the film. David Corenswet was a top contender for Superman and was set to do a screen test at the end of the month or in early June. Other actors in consideration included Jacob Elordi, Tom Brittney, and Andrew Richardson. Elordi declined to read for the role, feeling that it would be \"too much\" and \"too dark\" for him. Emma Mackey, Rachel Brosnahan, Samara Weaving, and Phoebe Dynevor had tested for Lane; Dynevor was one of the final contenders for that role. Nicholas Hoult, the runner-up to play Batman in The Batman (2022), was eyed for Luthor but chose to pursue the role of Superman. Gunn was considering A-list actors with whom he had previously worked for Luthor, and discussed the role with a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 actor that was reported to be Bradley Cooper. Black actors were also being considered. Testing took place using the label \"Apex\", a reference to a comic version of Luthor called Apex Luthor. Other comic book superheroes were expected to already be established in the film's setting, with casting underway for a Black actor to play Michael Holt / Mister Terrific and for an Asian or Latina actress to portray a character labeled \"Blitz\". Pierson Fod\u00e9, who appeared in an episode of Supergirl (2015\u20132021), and Jack Quaid, who voiced Superman in the animated series My Adventures with Superman (2023\u2013present), both submitted a self-tape for Superman.\nIn-person screen tests took place at the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, with Gunn and Safran in mid-June 2023. The actors tested in makeup and costume as Kent and Lane in the following pairs: Hoult and Brosnahan, Brittney and Dynevor, and Corenswet and Mackey. The Kent contenders then tested in costume as Superman against Mackey. Gunn edited the tests together to be played for a deciding committee that included Zaslav, and the casting of Corenswet as Superman and Brosnahan as Lane was announced on June 27. Casting for other roles was set to follow, including for members of the superhero team the Authority who were expected to be introduced in Superman: Legacy ahead of their own film. Brothers Alexander and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd were on the shortlist for Luthor. It was unclear if Hoult would return to try for Luthor again. On July 11, two years before the film's scheduled release date, the casting of Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi, and Nathan Fillion respectively as the superheroes Hawkgirl, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner / Green Lantern was announced. Merced tested as Barbara Gordon / Batgirl for the unreleased DCEU film Batgirl, while Fillion starred in several of Gunn's earlier films including as Cory Pitzner / T.D.K. in The Suicide Squad. Anthony Carrigan, who expressed interest in playing Luthor, was cast as the superhero Rex Mason / Metamorpho the next day. Gunn chose some of these actors some time earlier but had been waiting until Superman and Lane were cast before negotiating further actor deals, leaving little time to complete negotiations before the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14. In response to concerns that other superheroes would take away from the story of Superman and Lane, Gunn said those two characters remained the film's focus and the other actors were being cast for multiple DCU projects.\nWhen the WGA strike ended in September 2023, Superman: Legacy was expected to begin filming in early-to-mid 2024. Jason Momoa, who portrayed Aquaman in the DCEU, was reported the following month to have discussed portraying the character Lobo in either Superman: Legacy or a solo film. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, and filming was clarified to be beginning in March 2024. Gunn said the film would still make its July 2025 release date. Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda was revealed to be cast as Angela Spica / The Engineer, one of the film's antagonists and a member of the Authority, in mid-November. Singer Madison Beer said she submitted a self-tape and unsuccessfully auditioned for an undisclosed role, as did O'Shea Jackson Jr. Hoult was in talks to portray Luthor prior to the SAG-AFTRA strike, and negotiations for the role were continuing in November, when Sara Sampaio and Skyler Gisondo were revealed to have been respectively cast as Luthor's assistant Eve Teschmacher and Jimmy Olsen. Gunn said Gisondo, Sampaio, and de Far\u00eda had been cast prior to the strike, and the roles of Mister Terrific and Teschmacher were particularly difficult to cast and required many auditions. Journalist Jeff Sneider noted speculation that the character Sam Lane would appear and indicated that Michael Rooker was linked to the role, but Gunn denied that Rooker would play the character.\nIn December 2023, Gunn's brother Sean was cast as Maxwell Lord for future DCU projects, after Pedro Pascal played the role in the DCEU film Wonder Woman 1984 (2020). The character was expected to be referenced in Superman: Legacy but it was unknown if he would appear in the film. James Gunn confirmed that Hoult had finalized a deal to portray Luthor, and Miriam Shor entered negotiations for an undisclosed role after appearing in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The Hollywood Reporter also said the cast included Sean Gunn and Pom Klementieff, who starred in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, before James Gunn stated that Klementiff was not involved in the film and Shor had not been cast. He added that the film's script had been mostly completed prior to the writers' strike. Gunn said in January 2024 that work on the sets, prosthetics, and visual effects models were underway, the costumes were being completed, and most of the actors had been cast, while Brosnahan said the film was being made with a lot of love for the source material, as many cast and crew members had grown up watching Superman films and reading the comics. At the end of the month, Milly Alcock was cast as Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El / Supergirl. The character was reported to be making her debut in Superman: Legacy ahead of starring in her own DCU film, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow (2026). Alcock had performed auditions and screen tests in costume on the Superman: Legacy set in Atlanta, Georgia, earlier in January.\nPre-production work in Ohio began in early February 2024. Later that month, Bassem Youssef said he had been cast in the film\u2014reportedly as Rumaan Harjadi, the leader of a fictional Middle Eastern country\u2014but his character had been removed from the script. He believed this was potentially due to comments he made in October 2023 criticizing the Israeli government during the Israel\u2013Hamas war. Gunn disputed this, explaining that he had discussed a role with Youssef prior to the WGA strike but the actor had not been formally offered the part, and the character was removed from the final script after the strike ended and before Youssef's comments were made. Also in mid-February, the Ohio Department of Development announced that Superman: Legacy would be partially filmed in Cleveland and Cincinnati, Ohio, and had been awarded over $11 million through the state's tax credit program, based on a $37 million spend in the state out of the film's reported total budget of $363.8 million; Gunn disputed the accuracy of this budget, which would have made the film one of the most expensive superhero films ever made. A table read with the cast was held on February 22, and Gunn revealed that Terence Rosemore was portraying Luthor's henchman Otis after having small roles in some of Gunn's prior films. Zaslav said filming would begin the following week, when Gunn announced that he had shortened the film's title to Superman by the time he had completed the final draft of the script.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 29, 2024, which is the canonical birthday of Superman, in the Adventdalen valley in Svalbard, Norway. Filming took place there for one week to shoot scenes featuring the Fortress of Solitude. Gunn chose Svalbard for its natural beauty, landscapes, and similarities to the Arctic. Filming occurred under the working title Genesis. Henry Braham returned as cinematographer from the later two Guardians of the Galaxy films, The Suicide Squad, and The Flash. The film was shot entirely in IMAX. Filming was delayed from an initial January 2024 start by the SAG-AFTRA strike, and was expected to last around four months.\nAt the start of March, Wendell Pierce was cast as Perry White. Filming at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, had begun by March 8 and was expected to last until August 2. Filming was set to take place in Cleveland and Cincinnati, Ohio, for 37 days between April 1 and August 23. Filming was also expected to take place in Macon, Georgia. Later in April, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Neva Howell were cast as Jonathan and Martha Kent. In early June, Beck Bennett, Mikaela Hoover, and newcomer Christopher McDonald were cast as the Daily Planet employees Steve Lombard, Cat Grant, and Ron Troupe. Hoover previously appeared in several of Gunn's films. Characters from the animated DCU series Creature Commandos (2024) were expected to appear in the film by mid-June, and it was the intention of Gunn and Safran that the same actors would portray characters across animation and live-action in the DCU; set photos revealed that Frank Grillo was reprising his voice role as Rick Flag Sr. from that series.\nThe production moved to Northeast Ohio on June 14, when filming took place at the Headlands Beach State Park in Mentor, Ohio. Six weeks of filming took place throughout Cleveland, beginning in downtown Cleveland on June 24. Filming locations included Ontario Street, the Cleveland Greyhound Station, Public Square, the Detroit\u2013Superior Bridge, PNC Plaza, Progressive Field, and Cleveland Arcade. Exterior shots of the Huntington Bank Building, Key Tower, and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument were filmed in Public Square. The exterior of the Leader Building stood in for the headquarters of the Daily Planet, and Key Tower was used as the headquarters for Stagg Enterprises. Filming in Cleveland was completed on July 16, when Gunn said there were a couple weeks left of shooting. The production was then set to move to Cincinnati by July 18, to take place at the Cincinnati Museum Center in the Union Terminal and in a portion of the Lytle Tunnel. Filming wrapped on July 30.\n\n\n=== Post-production ===\nJason Ballantine and William Hoy serve as the editors on the film; they respectively worked on The Flash and The Batman. St\u00e9phane Ceretti will serve as the visual effects supervisor after previously working with Gunn on Guardians of the Galaxy, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Much of the visual effects team from Vol. 3 was set to return to work with Gunn for Superman. In August 2024, Sean Gunn confirmed his casting as Maxwell Lord. The following month, Alan Tudyk was revealed to have a role after previously voicing the character Doctor Phosphorus in Creature Commandos, and Waid confirmed that Krypto was appearing in the film. Gunn officially confirmed Krypto's role in October and explained that the character's portrayal in the film was inspired by his dog Ozu, who was adopted soon after Gunn began writing Superman. He said Ozu was at first \"problematic to say the least... I remember thinking, 'Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?' \u2013 and thus Krypto came into the script and changed the shape of the story\".\n\n\n== Music ==\nIn December 2023, Gunn said most of the film's score and major themes had been written, but the composer had not been announced because their deal for the film had not yet been finalized. In February 2024, he announced that John Murphy was composing the film's score, after previously doing so for The Suicide Squad, The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\n\n\n== Marketing ==\n\nGunn marked the beginning of filming in February 2024 by posting a picture of Superman's shield, which commentators noted for its visual similarity to the character's costume in the Kingdom Come comic book, albeit with the classic yellow and red color scheme. Safran promoted the film on-stage during Warner Bros.' CinemaCon presentation that April, with Gunn, Corenswet, and Brosnahan appearing via video messages. The panel unveiled a full look at the film's Superman emblem and Gunn said he planned to attend the following year's event in-person with the cast to initiate the \"Summer of Superman\" in the lead-up to the film's release. Gunn released a first-look image of Corenswet in costume in early May, which depicts Superman suiting up while an alien-looking threat attacks in the background. Commentary on the image focused on the return of red briefs which were not included in the Man of Steel design. Elements of the costume were also compared to the design used in the New 52 comics by Jim Lee, while the character's pose and the attack in the background led to speculation about Superman's characterization in the film and what threats he may face. A display inspired by the film's Fortress of Solitude was included at Warner Bros.' Licensing Expo booth in Las Vegas later in May. Gunn released the first image of Krypto, alongside Corenswet's Superman, in October 2024 in honor of \"Adopt a Shelter Dog\" month.\n\n\n== Release ==\nSuperman is scheduled to be released theatrically by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on July 11, 2025, in IMAX. It will be the first film in the DCU's Chapter One: Gods and Monsters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nSuperman at IMDb",
            "Superman (also marketed as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 superhero film based on DC Comics featuring the eponymous character, played by Christopher Reeve. It is the first of four installments in the Superman film series starring Reeve as Superman. The film was directed by Richard Donner based on a screenplay by Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton. In addition to Reeve, the film features an ensemble cast including Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Jeff East, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, Jack O'Halloran, Maria Schell, and Sarah Douglas. It depicts the origin of Superman, including his infancy as Kal-El of Krypton, son of Jor-El (Brando), and his youthful years in the rural town of Smallville. Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane (Kidder) while battling the villainous Lex Luthor (Hackman).\nIlya Salkind had the idea of a Superman film in 1973 and, after a difficult process with DC Comics, the Salkinds bought the rights to the character the following year. Several directors, most notably Guy Hamilton, and screenwriters were associated with the project before Donner was hired to direct. Tom Mankiewicz was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a creative consultant credit. It was decided to film both Superman and its sequel Superman II (1980) simultaneously, with principal photography beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions arose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film.\nThe most expensive film made up to that point, with a budget of $55 million, Superman premiered at The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on December 10, 1978, and was released in the United Kingdom on December 14, and in the United States on December 15. The film was a critical and financial success; its worldwide box office earnings of $300 million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year. It received praise for Reeve's performance and John Williams's musical score, and was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound at the 51st Academy Awards, and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects. Groundbreaking in its use of special effects and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the film's legacy presaged the mainstream popularity of Hollywood's superhero film franchises. In 2017, Superman was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the planet Krypton, Jor-El, a member of the Kryptonian high council, sentences criminals General Zod, Non, and Ursa to the Phantom Zone. He warns the council that Krypton will be destroyed by its exploding red supergiant sun, but they dismiss his concerns. Before the planet's destruction, Jor-El and his wife Lara send their baby son Kal-El to Earth, where his unique physiology grants him evolving superhuman abilities. Kal-El's spaceship touches down near Smallville, Kansas. Found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are astonished when the infant lifts their truck, they adopt him, naming him Clark. As he grows, hiding his powers, Jonathan believes Clark was sent to Earth for a special purpose.\nSoon after Jonathan's fatal heart attack, a glowing green crystal from his spaceship that is hidden in the barn calls to Clark. This leads him to the Arctic, where a Fortress of Solitude, echoing Krypton's architecture, ascends from the ice. Inside, Jor-El's hologram reveals Clark's heritage and trains him for twelve years. Emerging in a blue-and-red suit bearing the House of El crest, he is cautioned against changing human history.\nClark is hired as a reporter for the Daily Planet in Metropolis. He is drawn to Lois Lane. After saving her from a helicopter accident, Clark secretly uses his powers in public acts of heroism, gaining immediate fame as the \"caped wonder\". Perry White, the Daily Planet's chief, seeks more information on this new hero. Clark later visits Lois, taking her on a flight, leading her to coin his name, \"Superman\".\nCriminal mastermind Lex Luthor discovers a joint U.S. Army/U.S. Navy missile test and plots to target the San Andreas Fault with reprogrammed missiles, though one is misdirected by his bumbling assistant, Otis. Suspecting Superman's interference, Lex identifies a Kryptonian meteorite, lethal to Superman. With Otis and his girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, Lex retrieves it and traps Superman in his lair, revealing his plan to sink the western U.S., making his desert land prime coastline. He weakens Superman using the meteor, now known as Kryptonite, and informs him of the misdirected missile set for Hackensack, New Jersey.\nConcerned for her mother in Hackensack, Teschmacher frees Superman, urging him to first stop the eastbound missile. He sends it to space but misses the westbound missile, which triggers severe earthquakes in California, endangering landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. Superman counteracts the devastation by mending the fault line. As Superman rescues others, Lois is trapped in her car by an aftershock, suffocating before he can save her. Distraught and enraged over his failure to save Lois, Superman disregards Jor-El's warning against altering history. Heeding Jonathan's belief in his purpose, he flies around Earth, reversing time to prevent Lois's death and the missile's destruction. After saving the West Coast, he imprisons Luthor and Otis, then soars into the sunrise.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMarlon Brando as Jor-El: Superman's biological father on Krypton. He has a theory about the planet exploding, yet the Council refuses to listen. He dies as the planet explodes but successfully sends his infant son to Earth as a means to help the child. Brando sued the Salkinds and Warner Bros. for $50 million because he felt cheated out of his share of the box office profits. This stopped Brando's footage from being used in Richard Lester's version of Superman II.\nGene Hackman as Lex Luthor: A scientific genius and businessman who is Superman's nemesis. It is he who discovers Superman's weakness and hatches a plan that puts millions of people in danger.\nChristopher Reeve as Clark Kent / Superman: Born on Krypton as Kal-El and raised on Earth, he is a being of immense power, strength, flight and invulnerability who, after realizing his destiny to serve mankind, uses his powers to protect and save others. As a means to protect his identity, he works in Metropolis at the Daily Planet as mild-mannered newspaper reporter Clark Kent and changes his clothes into a red-blue red caped suit with an S shield on its chest and is dubbed \"Superman\" by Lois. Reeve was picked from over 200 actors who auditioned for the role.\nJeff East as the teenage Clark Kent: As a teenager, he is forced to hide his superhuman abilities, making him unpopular among his classmates and frustrating his efforts to gain the attention of classmate Lana Lang (Diane Sherry). Following the death of his adoptive father, he travels to the Arctic to discover his Kryptonian heritage. East's dialogue in the film is redubbed by Christopher Reeve for the final cut.\nNed Beatty as Otis: Lex Luthor's bumbling henchman.\nJackie Cooper as Perry White: Clark Kent's hot-tempered boss at the Daily Planet. He assigns Lois to uncover the news of an unknown businessman purchasing a large amount of property in California. Keenan Wynn was originally cast, but dropped out shortly before filming because of heart disease. Cooper, who originally auditioned for Otis, was subsequently cast.\nGlenn Ford as Jonathan Kent: Clark Kent's adoptive father in Smallville during his youth. He is a farmer who teaches Clark skills that will help him in the future. He later has a fatal heart attack that changes Clark's outlook on his duty to others.\nTrevor Howard as the First Elder: Head of the Kryptonian Council, who does not believe Jor-El's claim that Krypton is doomed. He warns Jor-El: \"Any attempt by you to create a climate of fear and panic amongst the populace must be deemed by us an act of insurrection.\"\nMargot Kidder as Lois Lane: A reporter at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her strong interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.\nJack O'Halloran as Non: Large and mute, the third of the Kryptonian villains who are sentenced to be isolated in the Phantom Zone.\nValerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher: Lex Luthor's girlfriend and accomplice. Already cynical of his increasing grandiosity and disturbed by his cruelty, she saves Superman's life after learning that Luthor has launched a nuclear missile toward her mother's hometown of Hackensack, New Jersey. She shows a romantic interest in Superman, implied by her fixing her hair before she makes her presence known to him, and then by kissing him before she saves his life.\nMaria Schell as Vond-Ah: Like Jor-El, a top Kryptonian scientist; but she too is not swayed by Jor-El's theories.\nTerence Stamp as General Zod: Evil leader of the three Kryptonian criminals who swears vengeance against Jor-El when he is sentenced to the Phantom Zone. His appearance was to set him and his accomplices as the main antagonists of Superman II.\nPhyllis Thaxter as Martha Kent (n\u00e9e Clark): Clark Kent's faithful adoptive mother. A kindly woman who dotes on her adoptive son and is fiercely devoted to her husband, Jonathan. She is her son's emotional support after Clark is devastated by Jonathan's death. Thaxter was producer Ilya Salkind's mother-in-law.\nSusannah York as Lara: Superman's biological mother on Krypton. She, after learning of Krypton's fate, has apprehensions about sending her infant son to a strange planet alone.\nMarc McClure as Jimmy Olsen: A teenage photographer at the Daily Planet. Jeff East, who portrayed the teenage Clark Kent, originally auditioned for this role but outranked following his portrayal of the teen Clark.\nSarah Douglas as Ursa: General Zod's second in command and consort, sentenced to the Phantom Zone for her unethical scientific experiments. Caroline Munro turned down the opportunity to play Ursa, in favour of Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me.\nHarry Andrews as the Second Elder: Council member, who urges Jor-El to be reasonable about plans to save Krypton.\nKirk Alyn and Noel Neill have cameo appearances (they played the parents of young Lois Lane in a deleted scene that was restored in later home media releases). Alyn and Neill portrayed Superman and Lois Lane in the film serials Superman (1948) and Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), and were the first actors to portray the characters onscreen in a live-action format. Neill reprised her role in the 1950s Adventures of Superman TV series.\nLarry Hagman and Rex Reed also make cameos; Hagman plays an army major in charge of a convoy that is transporting one of the missiles, and Reed plays himself as he meets Lois and Clark outside the Daily Planet headquarters.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIlya Salkind had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973. In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with DC Comics, the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya, his father Alexander Salkind, and their partner Pierre Spengler. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman. The filmmakers felt it was best to film Superman and Superman II back-to-back, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay, while Leigh Brackett was considered. Ilya hired Alfred Bester, who began writing a film treatment. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired Mario Puzo to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary. Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester (who later directed Superman II and III), Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. George Lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to Star Wars.\nIlya wanted to hire Steven Spielberg to direct, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to \"wait until [Spielberg's] big fish opens.\" Jaws was very successful, prompting the producers to offer Spielberg the position, but by then Spielberg had already committed to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Guy Hamilton was hired as director, while Puzo delivered his script for Superman and Superman II in July 1975. Jax-Ur appeared as one of General Zod's henchmen, with Clark Kent written as a television reporter. Dustin Hoffman, who was previously considered for Superman, turned down Lex Luthor.\nIn early 1975, Brando signed on as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7 million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19 million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green suitcase or a bagel with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13-part Roots-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in twelve days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage \"because they would be committed to other films immediately.\" Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts as \"very heavy\", and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing The Late Show, so David's wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to do some work on the script, but he says he did little.\nTheir script was submitted in July 1976, and had a camp tone, including a cameo appearance by Telly Savalas as his Kojak character. The scripts for Superman and Superman II were now at over 400 pages combined. Pre-production started at Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome, with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented. \"In Italy\", producer Ilya Salkind remembered, \"we lost about $2 million [on flying tests].\" Marlon Brando found out he could not film in Italy because of a warrant out for his arrest: a sexual-obscenity charge from Last Tango in Paris. Production moved to England in late 1976, but Hamilton could not join because he was a tax exile. Hamilton left the project as he was also ill.\nMark Robson was strongly considered and was in talks to direct, but after seeing The Omen, the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning Damien: Omen II when he was hired in January 1977 for $1 million to direct Superman and Superman II. Donner felt it was best to start from scratch. \"They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me.\" Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz, \"not a word from the Puzo script was used.\" \"It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'\", Donner continued. \"That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much.\" Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.\n\n\n==== Casting of Superman ====\nIt was initially decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner was hired as director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested and met with Donner, but he was more interested casting an \"unknown\" actor. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4 million, turning down all three roles.\nWhen it was next decided to cast an unknown actor, casting director Lynn Stalmaster first suggested Christopher Reeve, but Donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny. Over 200 unknown actors auditioned for Superman.\nOlympic champion Bruce Jenner auditioned for the title role. Patrick Wayne was cast, but dropped out when his father John Wayne was diagnosed with stomach cancer.\nBoth Neil Diamond and Arnold Schwarzenegger lobbied hard for the role, but were ignored. James Caan, James Brolin, Lyle Waggoner, Christopher Walken, Nick Nolte, Jon Voight, and Perry King were approached. Nolte wanted to play Superman as a schizophrenic. Kris Kristofferson and Charles Bronson were also considered for the title role. Warren Beatty was offered the role but turned it down.\nJames Caan said he was offered the part but turned it down. \"I just couldn't wear that suit.\"\n\"We found guys with fabulous physique who couldn't act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like Superman\", creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz remembered. The search became so desperate that producer Ilya Salkind's wife's dentist was screen tested.\nStalmaster convinced Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve stunned the director and producers. He was told to wear a \"muscle suit\" to produce the desired muscular physique, but Reeve refused, instead undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 pounds (85 kg) to 212 pounds (96 kg) during pre-production and filming. Reeve earned only $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman. However, Reeve felt, \"Superman brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face.\" Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. \"I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind\", East commented. \"It was done without my permission but it turned out to be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later.\" East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. Technicians applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to increase his resemblance to Reeve.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began on March 28, 1977, at Pinewood Studios for the Krypton scenes, budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point, which was $55 million. Because Superman was being shot simultaneously with Superman II, filming lasted nineteen months, until October 1978. Filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months, but problems arose during production. John Barry served as production designer, while Stuart Craig and Norman Reynolds worked as art directors. Derek Meddings and Les Bowie were credited as visual effects supervisors. Stuart Freeborn was the make-up artist, while Barry, David Tomblin, John Glen, David Lane, Robert Lynn and an uncredited Peter Duffell and Andr\u00e9 de Toth directed second unit scenes. Vic Armstrong was hired as the stunt coordinator and Reeve's stunt double; his wife Wendy Leech was Kidder's double. Superman was also the final complete film by cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who died during post-production while working on Tess for director Roman Polanski. The Fortress of Solitude was constructed at Shepperton Studios and at Pinewood's 007 Stage. Upon viewing the footage of Krypton, Warner Bros. decided to distribute in not only North America, but also in foreign countries. Due to complications and problems during filming, Warner Bros. also supplied $20 million and acquired television rights.\nNew York City doubled for Metropolis, while the New York Daily News Building served as the location for the offices of the Daily Planet. Brooklyn Heights was also used. Filming in New York lasted five weeks, during the time of the New York City blackout of 1977. Production moved to Alberta for scenes set in Smallville, with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of Beynon, Alberta, the high school football scenes at Barons, Alberta, and the Kent farm constructed at Blackie, Alberta. Brief filming also took place in Gallup, New Mexico; Lake Mead; and Grand Central Terminal. Director Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz reflected, \"Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'Why don't you just schedule the film for the next two days, and then I'll be nine months over?'\" Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers, was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing to talk to each other. On his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, \"At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him.\"\nLester was offered producing credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. \"Being there all the time meant he [Lester] could take over\", Salkind admitted. \"[Donner] couldn't make up his mind on stuff.\" On Lester, Donner reflected, \"He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me.\"\nIt was decided to stop shooting Superman II and focus on finishing Superman. Donner had already completed 75% of the sequel. The filmmakers took a risk: if Superman was a box office bomb, they would not finish Superman II. The original climax for Superman II had General Zod, Ursa, and Non destroying the planet, with Superman time traveling to fix the damage.\nDonner commented, \"I decided if Superman is a success, they're going to do a sequel. If it ain't a success, a cliffhanger ain't gonna bring them to see Superman II.\"\n\n\n=== Effects ===\n\nSuperman contains large-scale visual effects sequences. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet (20 m) long and 20 feet (6 m) high. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. The car crashes on the Golden Gate Bridge were a mixture of models and stunt drivers on a disused runway. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.\nAs detailed in the Superman: The Movie DVD special effects documentary \"The Magic Behind The Cape\", presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Field, in the end, three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects.\nFor landings and take-offs, wire flying-riggings were devised and used. On location, these were suspended from tower cranes, whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious\u2014the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard, for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did much of the work himself, and was suspended as high as 50 feet (15 m) in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).\nFor stationary shots where Superman is seen flying toward or away from the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be inserted into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would give the appearance of flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image\u2014in this case, Superman\u2014do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.\nWhere the shot is tracking with Superman as he flies (such as in the Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.\nA technique was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also led to the creation of the Zoptic system.\nThe highly reflective costumes worn by the Kryptonians are made of the same 3M material used for the front projection screens and were the result of an accident during Superman flying tests. \"We noticed the material lit up on its own\", Donner explained. \"We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce out in front of the lens, hit the costume, [and] millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera.\"\nThe Clio Award-winning opening titles were made with traditional optical animation using an innovative technique that combined a motion control camera with slit-scan photography. The titles were designed by Richard Greenberg of R/Greenberg Associates (R/GA)\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nJerry Goldsmith, who scored Donner's The Omen, was originally set to compose Superman. Portions of Jerry Goldsmith's work from Planet of the Apes were used in Superman's teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts, and John Williams was hired. Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the soundtrack. The music was one of the last pieces to come into place. Williams' \"Theme from Superman (Main Title)\" was released as a single, reaching #81 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #69 Cash Box. Williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it.\nKidder was supposed to sing \"Can You Read My Mind?\", the lyrics to which were written by Leslie Bricusse, but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover. Maureen McGovern eventually recorded the single, \"Can You Read My Mind?\" in 1979, although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack. It became a mid-chart hit on the Billboard Hot 100 that year (#52), spending three weeks at number five on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding Canadian charts. It was also a very minor hit on the U.S. Country chart, reaching #93. Both Williams' and McGovern's singles contained theme music from the score. The score earned John Williams an Academy Award nomination, but he lost to Giorgio Moroder's score for Midnight Express.\nThe soundtrack was originally released as a 2-LP set in December 1978, and the same recording was issued on CD for the first time in 1987 (with the tracks \"Growing Up\" and \"Lex Luthor's Lair\" omitted to fit the recording onto one disc).\nA re-recording of the score, conducted by John Debney and performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, was released by Varese Sarabande records in 1998. In 2000, an expanded edition of the original score was released on a 2-CD set by Rhino Records.\nIn February 2008, Film Score Monthly released an 8-CD boxed set titled Superman: The Music, including a newly restored complete score on the first two discs, as well as alternates and source cues on disc 8. As part of the film's 40th anniversary in February 2019, La-La Land Records released the fully expanded restoration of Williams' score on a 3-disc set, including the previously issued alternates and source music.\n\n\n== Themes ==\n\nSuperman is divided into three basic sections, each having a distinct theme and visual style. The first segment, set on Krypton, is meant to be typical of science fiction films, but also lays the groundwork for an analogy that emerges in the relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El. The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of 1950s films, and its small-town atmosphere is meant to evoke a Norman Rockwell painting. The third (and largest) segment, set mostly in Metropolis, was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible (what Donner called \"verisimilitude\"), relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a campy approach.\nIn each of the three acts, the mythic status of Superman is enhanced by events that recall the hero's journey (or monomyth) as described by Joseph Campbell. Each act has a discernible cycle of \"call\" and journey. The journey is from Krypton to Earth in the first act, from Smallville to the Fortress of Solitude in the second act, and then from Metropolis to the whole world in the third act.\nMany have noted the examples of apparent Christian symbolism. Donner, Tom Mankiewicz and Ilya Salkind have commented on the use of Christian references to discuss the themes of Superman. Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El (God) and Kal-El (Jesus). Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz's actions, joking \"I got enough death threats because of that.\"\nSeveral concepts and items of imagery have been used in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth is in the form of a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, \"All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child\", which was compared to the Virgin Mary.\nMirroring Biblical accounts of Jesus, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, \"Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.\" The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, featuring the fall, resurrection and his battle with evil. Another vision was that of The Creation of Adam.\nThe Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi Simcha Weinstein's book Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero, says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a \"nebbish\", saying \"He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's Woody Allen.\" Ironically, it is also in the Reeve films that Clark Kent's persona has the greatest resemblance to Woody Allen, though his conscious model was Cary Grant's character in Bringing Up Baby. This same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero by Danny Fingeroth.\nIn the scene where Lois Lane interviews Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, \"I never lie.\" Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his secret identity as Clark Kent, is \"telling the biggest lie of all time\". His romance with Lois also leads him to contradict Jor-El's orders to avoid altering human history, time traveling to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth.\n\n\n== Release ==\nSuperman was originally scheduled to be released in June 1978, the 40th anniversary of Action Comics 1, which first introduced Superman, but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months. Editor Stuart Baird reflected, \"Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months.\" Donner, for his part, wished that he had \"had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point, you've gotta turn the picture over.\"\nWarner Bros. Pictures spent $6\u20137 million on marketing the film. Superman premiered at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., on December 10, 1978, with director Richard Donner and several cast members in attendance. Three days later, on December 13, it had a European Royal Charity Premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square in London, with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew in attendance.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nIt set a new all-time U.S. industry record for business during a pre-Christmas week with $12 million, and set new records for Warner Bros. for their best opening day ($2.8 million) and three-day weekend ($7.5 million). For the week of December 22\u201328, it set an all-time U.S. weekly record of $18.5 million. It also set a record single day gross for Warner Bros. with a gross of $3.8 million. In its third weekend it grossed $13.1 million for the four-day holiday weekend setting a record 18-day gross of $43.7 million.\nApproximately 120 million people saw Superman in the opening theatrical run in 1978. Including re-releases, it went on to gross $134.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $166 million internationally, totaling $300.5 million worldwide. Superman was the second highest-grossing film of 1978 in North America. It was also Warner Bros.'s most successful film at the time.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nSuperman received mostly positive reviews from critics. According to Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 77 critics gave Superman a positive review, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Superman deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast Reeve to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". The film was widely regarded as one of the top ten films of 1978. Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, in tears, thanked Donner and gave a positive reaction. Shuster was \"delighted to see Superman on the screen. I got chills. Chris Reeve has just the right touch of humor. He really is Superman.\" Siegel beamed, \"It's exactly as I imagined it.\"\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars. Although describing the Krypton scenes as \"ponderous\" (\"Brando was allegedly paid $3 million for his role, or, judging by his dialogue, $500,000 a clich\u00e9\"), Ebert wrote that \"Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects, and \u2013 you know what else? Wit\". He praised Reeve, stating that he \"sells the role; wrong casting here would have sunk everything\", and concluded that the film \"works so well because of its wit and its special effects\". Ebert placed the film on his ten best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his \"Great Movies\" list. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four, calling it \"a delightful mess. Good performances. Sloppy editing. Cheap nonflying special effects. Funny dialog. In sum, Superman is the kind of picture critics tear apart, but still say, 'You ought to see it.'\"\nJames Harwood of Variety called the film \"a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy\", and he further added: \"As both the wholesome man of steel and his bumbling secret identity Clark Kent, Reeve is excellent. As newswoman Lois Lane, Kidder plays perfectly off both of his personalities and her initial double-entendre interview with Superman is wickedly coy, dancing round the obvious question any red-blooded girl might ask herself about such a magnificent prospect.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in a mixed review, \"The Superman comic strip has been carefully, elaborately, sometimes wittily blown up for the big-theater screen, which, though busy, often seems sort of empty.\" He did however praise the performance of Kidder, calling her \"most charming\". Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"a big letdown\", praising Reeve as \"the salvaging strength of the film\" but referring to the matter of the villain as \"an essential problem\", finding that \"even in a succession of wigs, Gene Hackman is not preposterous, funny or dementedly menacing, and what he's doing here is not evident.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote in a positive review, \"Despite a lull here and a lapse there, this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable, doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras\u2014Christopher Reeve, a young actor at once handsome and astute enough to rationalize the preposterous fancy of a comic-book superhero in the flesh.\" He felt that Kidder was \"a good actress and a phenomenal screamer, but she looks a little exhausted.\"\nWriting in a retrospective review, James Berardinelli believed \"there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of Superman II.\" Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as \"simply puffed-up TV episodes.\" After Kidder's death in 2018, Sonia Saraiya of Vanity Fair retrospectively praised her ability to balance Lois's ditzy nature with her ambition and no-nonsense attitude, calling her a worthy foil to Reeve and writing that \"Kidder played a human woman who could believably both attract and deserve a man who is canonically perfect, with the physique of a Greek god and the moral compass of a saint.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSuperman was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Film Editing (Stuart Baird), Best Original Score (John Williams) and Best Sound (Gordon K. McCallum, Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier and Roy Charman) and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for its visual effects. Donner publicly expressed disgust that production designer John Barry and cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth had not been recognized by the Academy.\nSuperman was also successful at the 32nd British Academy Film Awards. Reeve won Best Newcomer, while Hackman, Unsworth, Barry, and the sound designers earned nominations. The film won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. At the Saturn Awards, Kidder, Barry, John Williams, and the visual effects department received awards, and the film won Best Science Fiction Film. Reeve, Hackman, Donner, Valerie Perrine, and costume designer Yvonne Blake were nominated for their work as well. In addition, Williams was nominated at the 36th Golden Globe Awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\n\n== Television and home media ==\n\n\n=== The extended TV version ===\nWhile, by contract, Richard Donner had major editorial control over what was theatrically released, the Salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters. This was the result of deals that had been made between the producers and the ABC television network prior to the film's release. Financially, the more footage that was restored for television, the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast (the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in). During production of the film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind found themselves in the position of having to sell more and more of their rights back to Warner Bros. in exchange for financial help, which is why Warner Bros. had theatrical and home video distribution rights. By 1981, when the television rights reverted to the Salkinds, the producers had already prepared a 3-hour-and-8-minute version that actually had been the first version of the film visually locked down prior to being re-edited for theatrical release. This extended cut, which would be used for worldwide television distribution, reincorporated some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut. Networks and stations could then re-edit their own version at their discretion. This edit is commonly known as the \"Salkind International Television Cut\".\nABC aired the broadcast television debut of Superman over two nights in February 1982, with a majority of the unused footage. The 182-minute network cut (which was slightly cut down for content) was repeated in November of that same year, this time in its entirety in one evening. ABC presented the original theatrical version of the film for the two remaining broadcasts.\nWhen the TV rights reverted to Warner Bros. in 1985, CBS aired the film one last time on network television in its theatrical version. When the movie entered the syndication market in 1988 (following a play-out run on pay cable) TV stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut. The stations that showed the extended cut edited the second half to add more advertising time and \"previously on ...\" cutback scenes just as ABC had done in 1982.\nIn 1994 (following a pay-cable reissue and its obligatory run on USA Network), Warner Bros. Television syndicated the full 188-minute international television version, most famously on Los Angeles station KCOP. The most notable additions unseen on U.S. television were two additional scenes never seen before, in addition to what had been previously reinstated. This version also surfaced outside of Los Angeles. For example, WJLA Channel 7, an ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., aired the extended cut in July 1994. Because its first known airing was on the aforementioned KCOP, it is also known in fan circles as the \"KCOP Version\".\nThere were various extended TV versions each broadcast in various countries. Most of these are in pan and scan, as they were made in the 1980s, when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical aspect ratio on old TVs.\nUntil 2017, it was thought the quality of the extended network TV version was inferior to any theatrical or previous home video release because it was mastered in 16mm (using the \"film chain system\") and a mono sound mix done, as by the time the extended cut was prepared in 1981, stereo was not available in television broadcasts (16 mm television prints were, in fact, made and mastered on NTSC Standard Definition video for the initial ABC network broadcasts). However, during an inventory of the Warner Bros. library, an IP master of the full 188-minute television version was discovered. This eighteen-reel master was not marked with an aspect ratio, but the print was inspected and, as it turned out, was in the proper 2.35:1 Panavision ratio. This was the source of the Warner Archive Collection Blu-Ray release of what would officially be called the \"Superman: The Movie Extended Cut\", issued on October 3, 2017. The video release was visually restored by WB's imaging department, and, other than the opening and end credits (which are in true stereo), the film is presented in an enhanced version of the mono TV sound mix. This particular release also includes another version discussed below.\nRichard Donner was critical of this extended cut of the film. He called this version of the film \"terrible,\" saying it \"was nothing more than an assembly.\" He said he cut the bad material out of the movie and that the producers and Warner Bros. added it back in just \"to make a buck.\"\n\n\n=== Other editions ===\nWhen Michael Thau and Warner Home Video started working on a film restoration in 2000, only eight minutes of the added footage that had been used in the TV cut could be considered restored into a version that director Richard Donner called his preferred version of the film. Thau determined that some of the extra footage could not be added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt \"the pace of the film's storyline would be adversely affected [and there were] timing problems matching [footage] with John Williams' musical score, etc\u2026 The cut of the movie shown on KCOP was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV as the Television Station paid per minute to air the movie. The \"Special Edition\" cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making.\" There was a special test screening of the Special Edition in 2001 in San Antonio, Texas, on March 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year, which did not occur. In May 2001, Warner Home Video released the special edition on DVD. Director Donner also assisted, working slightly over a year on the project. The release included making-of documentaries directed by Thau and eight minutes of restored footage.\nThau explained, \"I worked on Ladyhawke and that's how I really met Dick [Donner] and Tom Mankiewicz. I used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'\". Donner commented, \"There are a few shots where Chris [Reeve]'s costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color back to where it should be.\" Thau wanted to make the film shorter: \"I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem (\"Can You Read My Mind\") when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action... It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [that] out [or] the poem.\" It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing \"bare bones\" editions of Superman II, Superman III, and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray. Also available (with other films) is the nine-disc \"Christopher Reeve Superman Collection\" and the 14-disc \"Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition\".\nOn November 6, 2018 (following year-long worldwide revival theatrical screenings to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the film's original release), Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released an Ultra HD Blu-ray of Superman presented in a new Dolby Vision transfer of the original theatrical version straight from the original camera negative, with its original 70mm/six-track stereo mix rendered in 5.1 surround, in addition to the 2000 remix in Dolby Atmos. This new release also includes a standard Blu-ray Disc of the theatrical cut, plus select bonus features carried over from previous video releases.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2007, the Visual Effects Society listed Superman as the 44th-most influential use of visual effects of all time. In 2008, Empire magazine named it the 174th-greatest film of all time on its list of 500. In 2009, Entertainment Weekly ranked Superman 3rd on their list of The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture.\nWith the film's success, it was immediately decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler did not ask Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, \"I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing to say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me.\" Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. Kidder said that as a result, she was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, \"It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds.\" Two more films, Superman III (1983) and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), were produced. Donner's vision for Superman II was eventually realized nearly three decades later, when he supervised the editing of Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, which was released in 2006. In the same year, Donner and writer Geoff Johns wrote \"Last Son\", a comic book story arc in Action Comics featuring Superman. Unused footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, discovered during the restoration of Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, was used in Superman Returns (2006).\nBecause Superman went into production prior to the releases of Star Wars (May 1977) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (November 1977), some observers credit the three films collectively for launching the reemergence of a large market for science fiction films\nin the 1980s. This is certainly the view of Superman producer Ilya Salkind and some who have interviewed him, as well as of film production assistant Brad Lohan. Other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the Lucas and Spielberg productions, and see Superman as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two. Ilya Salkind denies any connection between Superman\u2014which began filming in March 1977\u2014and the other films, stating that \"I did not know about 'Star Wars'; 'Star Wars' did not know about 'Superman'; 'Close Encounters' did not know about 'Superman.' It really was completely independent\u2014nobody knew anything about anybody.\" Superman also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of low-budget Saturday matinee serials. Director Christopher Nolan cited Richard Donner's vision and scope of Superman when pitching the concept for Batman Begins to Warner Bros. in 2002. The film's influence can also be seen in films of the genre including the X-Men films, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (2002), and Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman (2017).\nIn 2021, DC Comics revived the continuity of the 1978 film with their Superman '78 comic book series, emulating the look of the Christopher Reeve films. The series picks up where the first two films left off, thereby acting as a direct sequel.\nAfter the first screening of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film The Flash (2023) to the attendees of the Cinemacon 2023, director Andy Muschietti and producer Barbara Muschietti revealed that a cameo appearance of Brando's Jor-El from Superman was considered for the film, but was left in the \"cutting floor room\" due to not fitting in the story.\nThe film inspired The Kinks' 1979 song \"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\", when the band's main songwriter, Ray Davies, watched the film in late 1978.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n2003: AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains:\nSuperman (Clark Kent) \u2013 #26 Hero\nIn December 2017, the film was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry, for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Cited works ===\nAndersen, Christopher (2008).

            "Superman is a 1948 15-part Columbia Pictures film serial based on the comic book character Superman. It stars an uncredited Kirk Alyn (billed on-screen only by his character's name, Superman; but credited as Kirk Alyn on the promotional posters) and Noel Neill as Lois Lane. Like Batman (1943), it is notable as the first live-action appearance of Superman on film, and for the longevity of its distribution. The serial was directed by Thomas Carr, who later directed many early episodes of the Adventures of Superman television series, and Spencer Gordon Bennet, produced by Sam Katzman, and shot in and around Los Angeles, California. It was originally screened at movie matin\u00e9es, and after the first three scene-setting chapters, every episode ends in a cliffhanger. The Superman-in-flight scenes are animations, in part due to the small production budget.\nA \"tremendous\" financial success, the serial was a popular success that made Kirk Alyn famous and launched Noel Neill's career. A sequel serial, Atom Man vs. Superman, also directed by Bennet, was released in 1950.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSuperman is sent to Earth by his parents just as the planet Krypton blows up and is later raised as Clark Kent by a farm couple. They discover that he has great powers so they send him off to use his powers to help those in need. After his foster parents die, the Man of Steel heads to Metropolis under the bespectacled guise of Kent and joins the staff of the Daily Planet in order to be close to the news. Soon after he is sent out to get the scoop on a new rock that a man has found that he calls Kryptonite, and Clark passes out; then and there Superman discovers that his weakness is Kryptonite. Whenever emergencies happen, he responds in his true identity as Superman. This first serial revolves around the nefarious plot of a villain who calls herself the Spider Lady.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\nKirk Alyn as Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman\nMason Alan Dinehart as young Clark Kent\nNoel Neill as Lois Lane\nPierre Watkin as Perry White\nTommy Bond as Jimmy Olsen\nCarol Forman as Spider Lady\nHerbert Rawlinson as Dr. Graham\nForrest Taylor as Professor Arnold Leeds\nNelson Leigh as Jor-El\nLuana Walters as Lara\nEdward Cassidy as Eben Kent\nVirginia Carroll as Martha Kent\nAlyn, Neill, Watkin, and Bond reprised their roles in the 1950 sequel, Atom Man vs. Superman.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nRepublic Pictures tried twice to produce a Superman serial. The first attempt was replaced by Mysterious Doctor Satan (1940), when licensing negotiations with Superman publisher National Comics (later called DC Comics) failed. A second attempt was advertised for a 1941 release, but this time, two obstacles doomed production. National Comics insisted on absolute control of the script and production, and the rights to Superman were already committed to the Paramount cartoon series. Sam Katzman acquired the live-action rights in 1947. He tried to sell them to Universal, but they no longer made serials by then. He also tried to sell to Republic, but they claimed that \"a superpowerful flying hero would be impossible to adapt\"\u2014despite having already successfully done just that with Adventures of Captain Marvel in 1941. Also, Republic was no longer buying properties for adaptation by 1947. Columbia accepted the offer.\nSam Katzman found Kirk Alyn after looking through photographs, but had a hard time selling the idea of casting Alyn to Whitney Ellsworth, National Comics' representative on the project. This was made even worse when Alyn came in for a screen test, sporting a goatee and moustache (as he was also shooting another project, a historical film). These initial reservations were eventually overcome, and Alyn got the part. Columbia's advertising claimed that it could not get an actor to fill the role, so it had \"hired Superman himself\", and Kirk Alyn was merely playing Clark Kent.\nGeorge Plympton added a joke to script, substituting the Lone Ranger's \"Hi-Yo Silver!\" for the traditional \"Up, up, and away\". This did not survive in the script long enough to actually be filmed. The Superman costume was grey and brown, instead of blue and red, because those colors photographed better on black and white film. It was never explained why his costume is shown as red and green on the one-sheet posters.\nEpisode 1, \"Superman Comes to Earth\", features a line delivered by Edward Cassidy (as Eben Kent) to Kirk Alyn (as foster son Clark Kent): \"Because of these great powers - your speed and strength, your x-ray vision and super-sensitive hearing - you have a great responsibility\". Fourteen years later, Stan Lee's Amazing Fantasy #15 introduced Spider-Man and popularized the motto, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".\n\n\n=== Special effects ===\nSuperman's flight sequences were animated instead of live-action or model work. Harmon and Glut consider this to be the weakest point of the serial, explaining that the effects created by Republic for Adventures of Captain Marvel were more convincing or more routine ones for the Superman TV series. While there were other effective special effects, in their opinion, they were undermined by the poorness of the flying sequences. The film crew did test an alternative method of filming the flying sequences: Kirk Alyn spent an entire day painfully suspended by visible wires in front of a rear projection of moving clouds. Displeased with the results, Katzman fired the entire flight sequence production staff, and used the animated method instead.\nA peculiar characteristic of the mix of animated and live-action footage is that Superman's take-offs are almost always visible in the foreground, while his landings almost always occur behind objects, such as parked cars, rocks, and buildings. It was easier to shift from live footage of Kirk Alyn starting to take off, to animated footage, than it was to shift from an animated landing to live footage of the actor. As a consequence of the need to hide Superman's landings, Superman frequently lands at some distance from where he wants to be, and must run to arrive on-scene.\nBudget limitations also dictated the frequent re-use of film footage, especially scenes of Superman flying. For example, one sequence showing Superman flying over a rocky hill (a shot of Stoney Point in Southern California's San Fernando Valley) was used at least once in almost every episode of the first serial.\n\n\n=== Stunts ===\nAlyn's stunt double was Paul Stader. He had to perform only one stunt in the entire serial, leaping from the back of a truck. He almost broke his leg during this stunt, and had to leave the production.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThe Superman serial was first made available for purchase on VHS videotape in 1987 as a double tape box set. The serial was also offered available in two separate VHS tapes as \"Volume 1\" (Chapters 1 to 7) and \"Volume 2\" (Chapters 8 to 15).\nIt was officially released on DVD by Warner Home Video, along with its sequel Atom Man vs. Superman, on November 28, 2006 as Superman: The Theatrical Serials Collection. Warner released the serials rather than Columbia, as Warner's subsidiary DC Comics acquired the rights to the serials several years beforehand. With the previous 2006 DVD release out of print for a few years, the serials were re-released as manufactured-on-demand (MOD) DVD from Warner Archive Collection on October 9, 2018.\n\n\n== Chapter titles ==\nSuperman Comes To Earth\nDepths Of The Earth\nThe Reducer Ray\nMan Of Steel\nA Job For Superman\nSuperman In Danger\nInto The Electric Furnace\nSuperman To The Rescue\nIrresistible Force\nBetween Two Fires\nSuperman's Dilemma\nBlast In The Depths\nHurled To Destruction\nSuperman At Bay\nThe Payoff\nSource:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nLook, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman\n\n\n== External links ==\nSuperman at IMDb\nSuperman at Rotten Tomatoes\nSuperman at AllMovie\nAtom Man vs. Superman (1950)",
            "Superman and the Mole Men (titled onscreen as Superman and the Mole-Men) is a 1951 American independent black-and-white superhero film released by Lippert Pictures. Produced by Barney A. Sarecky and directed by Lee Sholem, it stars George Reeves as Superman and Phyllis Coates as Lois Lane. It is the first feature film based on any DC Comics character.\nThe film's story centers on reporters Clark Kent (George Reeves) and Lois Lane (Phyllis Coates) arriving in the small town of Silsby to witness the drilling of the world's deepest oil well. However, the drill has penetrated the underground home of a race of small, bald humanoids who, out of curiosity, climb to the surface at night. They glow in the dark, which scares the local townspeople who form a mob intent on killing the creatures. Only Superman can intervene to prevent tragedy.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nClark Kent and Lois Lane arrive in the small town of Silsby to report on the world's deepest oil well. That night, two small, furry, bald dwarf humanoids emerge through the shaft and scare the elderly night watchman to death. Lois and Clark arrive at the oil well and find the dead watchman. Clark and the foreman explore the surrounding area for signs of foul play, but then Lois glimpses one of the creatures. However, no one believes her when she tells them what she saw.\nThe medical examiner is summoned, and he later leaves with Lois. Clark stays behind to confront the foreman, who confesses that the well was closed out of fear they had struck radium and not oil. The foreman proceeds to show Clark ore samples that were collected during different stages of drilling; all of them glow brightly.\nMeanwhile, the two Mole Men explore the town, but the residents become terrified because of their peculiar appearance and the fact that everything they touch glows in the dark due to phosphorescence. Soon, an angry mob forms, led by the violent Luke Benson (Jeff Corey), to kill the \"monsters\". Superman (George Reeves) stops Benson and the mob and saves one of the creatures in mid-air after it is shot from the top of a dam. While Superman takes it to the hospital, the second creature returns to the wellhead and disappears down its shaft.\nA doctor announces that the injured creature will die unless it has surgery to remove the bullet. When a nurse refuses to do so out of fear, Clark volunteers to assist. Benson's mob arrives at the hospital demanding that the creature be turned over to them. Superman stands guard outside the hospital with Lois, but a shot is fired from the mob and narrowly misses her. Superman sends her inside and single-handedly disarms the mob.\nThree more Mole Men emerge from the drill shaft, this time bearing a strange weapon. They make their way to the hospital, where Benson and his mob see them; Benson decides to go after them alone. The creatures fire their laser-like weapon at him, but Superman jumps in front of the ray, saving Benson's life. Superman fetches the wounded creature from the hospital and carries him alongside his companions as they return to the wellhead. After descending back down, the Mole Men destroy the drill shaft, ensuring that no one can come up or go down it.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe sympathetic treatment of the strangers in the film, and the unreasoning fear on the part of the townspeople, has been compared by author Gary Grossman to the panicked public reaction to the peaceful alien Klaatu in the science fiction film The Day The Earth Stood Still, which was released the same year. Both have been considered retrospectively as the product of (and a reaction to) the \"Red Scare\" of post-World War II era. Grossman also cites the later film The Mole People (1956).\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nSuperman and the Mole Men is the first theatrical feature film based on any DC Comics character. Previously, there was a series of 17 produced technicolor animated Superman short subjects theatrically released by Paramount Pictures' Fleischer Studios. Two live-action, multiple chapter movie serials made by Columbia Pictures Inc., based on the Superman comics feature and radio program, featuring Kirk Alyn as Superman and Noel Neill as Lois Lane, had been shown in weekly installments in movie theaters. Two additional serials based on DC's Batman, the first featuring Lewis Wilson as Batman and Douglas Croft as Robin / Dick Grayson, and the second featuring Robert Lowery as Batman and Johnny Duncan as Robin, were also made by Columbia (1943 and 1949).\nThe original screenplay was by \"Richard Fielding\", a pseudonym for Robert Maxwell and Whitney Ellsworth.\nSuperman and the Mole Men was filmed in a little more than 12 days starting on July 10, 1951 at RKO-Pathe Studios. The feature runs just 58 minutes and originally served as a trial balloon release for the syndicated Adventures of Superman TV series, for which it became the only two-part episode, titled \"The Unknown People\". Some elements of the original film were trimmed when converted for television, including some portions of a lengthy chase scene and all references to \"Mole Men\". The original film score by Darrell Calker was also removed, replaced with production library music also used in the first season of the series.\nThe laser-like weapon of the Mole Men, which they retrieve from their subterranean home in order to defend themselves and rescue their injured comrade, was a prop made by adding metal shoulder braces to one end of an Electrolux vacuum cleaner body; for the ray's \"gun barrel\" a standard metal funnel was attached to the other.\nThe image of actors Reeves and Coates on the theatrical release poster is a painting derived by reversing (\"flopping\") a publicity photograph image of the two actors, with Superman's \"S shield\" emblem then reversed in order for it to read correctly.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released to theaters on November 6, 1951.\nSuperman and the Mole Men was first released on VHS by Warner Home Video on July 22, 1987, coinciding with the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Superman character that year.\nBoth the two-part TV episode and the full feature are on the 2005 first season DVD release for Adventures of Superman. During 2006, the film was released as a bonus feature on the DVD 4-Disc Special Edition of Superman: The Movie, then again as a bonus feature on a Blu-ray (presented in standard definition) box set in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWarren, Bill.

            "Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is a 2006 re-edited director's cut of the 1980 superhero film Superman II. It is a sequel to Richard Donner's 1978 film Superman, based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name, and stars Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, and Marlon Brando. This alternate cut was edited by Michael Thau and was overseen and completed by Donner himself. It features a significant amount of discarded footage, alternate takes, and story elements not featured in the theatrical version.\nIn 1979, after the tense nineteen month-long shoot on Superman and a significant portion of Superman II,  Alexander Salkind, who had bought the film rights to the character, removed Donner from production on the sequel and replaced him with director Richard Lester. Lester completed the remainder of the film for its theatrical release, but also re-wrote and re-shot a substantial portion of Donner's footage in order to receive full director's credit. While the sequel was a critical and financial success upon release,  interest in Donner's cut of Superman II became well known after a community of online fans began petitioning for Warner Bros. Pictures to release Donner's vision. After Marlon Brando's death in 2004, his family estate allowed for Warner Bros. to feature archival footage of the late actor in the 2006 film Superman Returns, thus granting the studio permission to restore Donner's version of Superman II.\nSince Donner never completed Superman II in its original form, certain key scenes filmed by Lester, along with newly created visual effects shots and an early screen test of one pivotal scene featuring Reeve and Margot Kidder, had to be added to the film in order to create a completed work. The film also features an early developed alternate opening and ending that were both envisioned before the theatrical release of Superman, in which the sequel's original ending was re-worked as the finale to the first film. Donner stated that, had he finished the film in 1980, he would have shot a different ending. Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and HD DVD on November 28, 2006, to positive reviews and is dedicated to Reeve's memory.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOn the planet Krypton, criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non are sentenced to eternal banishment inside the Phantom Zone by Jor-El for insurrection and murder, amongst other crimes. Thirty years later, Superman diverts a missile into outer space, unknowingly freeing them from the Phantom Zone.\nAt the Daily Planet in Metropolis, Lois Lane suspects that Clark Kent is Superman. She tests Clark by jumping out of a window, but Clark uses his powers to save her while appearing to have done nothing. Meanwhile, with the help of Eve Teschmacher, Lex Luthor escapes from prison, abandoning Otis. They find and infiltrate the Fortress of Solitude, learning of the impending doom brought by General Zod. Lex resolves to meet Zod, and begins tracking him. On the Moon, Zod, Ursa, and Non discover that they have superpowers due to Earth's yellow sun, and ruthlessly kill a group of astronauts.\nPerry White has Clark and Lois pose as newlyweds to investigate a honeymoon suite scam at Niagara Falls. Superman's appearance and rescue of a small boy at the Falls renews Lois' suspicions, and she tricks Clark with a gun loaded with blanks into admitting that he is Superman. He takes Lois Lane to the Fortress of Solitude, where the two spend the night together. Meanwhile, Zod, Ursa and Non arrive on Earth and conquer a small town in Idaho. After learning that the U.S. military takes orders from the President of the United States, the Kryptonians fly to Washington, D.C., and invade the White House.\nSuperman, unaware of Zod's release from the Phantom Zone and his subsequent rampage, decides to transform himself into a human and remove his super-powers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a crystal chamber. On their way back to Metropolis, Lois and Clark stop at a diner, where Clark gets beaten up by an obnoxious trucker and learns of Zod's conquest of the world. Knowing that humanity is helpless, Clark returns to the Fortress to reverse the transformation. Having anticipated this decision, Jor-El's artificial intelligence reveals it has been programmed to deal with this situation by sacrificing the remaining Kryptonian energy it needs to operate. To restore Clark's superpowers, it must be joined with him, fulfilling the Kryptonian prophecy concerning \"the father becoming the son\", resulting in the \"death\" of Jor-El and rendering the Fortress of Solitude inoperable.\nLex arrives at the White House. In exchange for Australia, he informs Zod that Superman is the son of Jor-El, and that he has the ability to find him. He takes the three Kryptonians to Metropolis to kidnap Lois as bait for Superman. Superman arrives and a fight ensues in and over Metropolis. After saving a bus full of civilians, Superman realizes he cannot win and flies to his Fortress, with Zod, Ursa, and Non in pursuit, bringing Lois and Lex with them. At the Fortress, Luthor shows the chamber that stripped Superman of his powers to Zod, who forces Superman to again undergo the transformation process. Superman, feigning defeat, reveals by crushing Zod's hand, that he has altered the process to expose everyone outside the chamber, removing the Kryptonian criminals' powers, while protecting himself. Zod, Ursa and Non are quickly dispatched. After destroying the Fortress of Solitude with his heat vision, Superman returns Lois to her apartment, where she wishes him a tearful goodbye, knowing that she can never be with him. To undo everything, Superman accelerates around Earth, traveling back in time to restore the past few days, rebuild the Fortress of Solitude and place Zod, Ursa and Non back into the Phantom Zone. Clark returns to work the following day as Lois and Perry experience a slight case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Clark revisits the diner with the obnoxious trucker to teach him a lesson in humility.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1977, director Richard Donner set about simultaneously filming an epic two-part adaptation of the Superman comic book series. Principal photography began on March 28, 1977, at Pinewood Studios for the Krypton scenes, but by May 1977, production had run two weeks behind schedule. It was reported that Donner had developed tensions with the Salkinds and Pierre Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and production schedule. Donner responded by claiming he was never given a budget. However, Donner told Starlog in March 1979, \"I got along with the Salkinds all right, but I didn't get on with Pierre Spengler. I told him to his face that the film was too big for him but he wouldn't face up to the responsibility. It had nothing to do with the film itself, it was in the making of the film\u2014the knowledge to pull it off.\"\nIn July 1977, Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974), was brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds who were no longer on speaking terms. During production, Lester enlisted to be a second unit director where he formed an effective partnership with Donner. By October 1977, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, and Valerie Perrine had completed their scenes as they were all under contract to finish both pictures. Nevertheless, with months left of filming, the Salkinds had halted filming Superman II and focus on finishing Superman by which time Donner had already completed 75% of the sequel.\nFollowing Superman's December 1978 release, it was widely assumed that Donner would be recalled to complete the remainder of the sequel. Spengler had encountered Variety columnist Army Archerd at a Christmas party, and assured him that while there had been tension, he was proud of the film and looked forward to working with him on the sequel. Archerd then contacted Donner in which he responded \"If he's on it\u2014I'm not.\" However, a number of events led to Donner's eventual replacement as director of the movie. Most importantly, producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind announced that Marlon Brando's completed scenes for Superman II would be excised from the movie in order for them to avoid having to pay the actor the reported 11.75% of gross U.S. box-office takings he was now demanding for his performance in the sequel. Donner publicly lambasted this decision, announcing that he would make the film his way or not at all. In January 1979, Donner had told Variety, \"That means no games... They have to want me to do it. It has to be on my terms and I don't mean financially. I mean control.\" As Donner had become unavailable during the European promotional campaign for Superman, the Salkinds approached Guy Hamilton to take over directional reins for Superman II since Lester was filming Cuba (1979) at the time. However, Hamilton was unavailable, but by the time Superman II was ready to begin filming, Lester had completed Cuba and was available to direct.\nEventually, on March 15, 1979, the Salkinds decided to replace Donner with Richard Lester. Donner recalled that \"One day, I got a telegram from them saying my services are no longer needed and that my dear friend Richard Lester would take over. To this day, I have not heard from them.\" Ilya Salkind countered, \"Dick Donner said, 'I will do the second movie on my terms and without [Pierre] Spengler'...Spengler was my friend since childhood and my father and I were very loyal guys. We said no, and it really boiled down to that.\"\n\n\n=== The 1980 theatrical Superman II ===\n\nWith Lester placed as director, he was not sympathetic to Donner's filmmaking style: \"Donner was emphasizing a kind of grandiose myth. There was a kind of David Lean-ish attempt in several sequences, and enormous scale. There was a type of epic quality which isn't in my nature, so my work really didn't embrace that...That's not me. That's his vision of it. I'm more quirky and I play around with slightly more unexpected silliness.\" Since Geoffrey Unsworth had died before the release of Superman, Lester brought on cinematographer Robert Paynter to have the film evoke the garish color scheme of the comics.\nTom Mankiewicz was approached by Terry Semel, then a Warner Bros. vice president, to return for the sequel, but he declined out of loyalty to Donner. Mankiewicz recounted \"I have a lot of respect for [Lester]. Friendship is more important than anything. And Dick [Donner] brought me on the picture and my loyalty was with Dick and I couldn't believe that they fired him.\" David and Leslie Newman were then brought back to re-tool the script constructing a new opening and an ending. The new opening involved Superman thwarting the nuclear terrorists at the Eiffel Tower. The new ending involved Clark causing Lois to forget his secret identity through a hypnotic kiss.\nAdditionally, Christopher Reeve had become unavailable as he had accepted an offer to star in the romantic fantasy film Somewhere in Time (1980), five months into the production shutdown, by which time his contract to shoot both Superman films back-to-back had expired. Reeve claimed that twelve hours after his casting was announced, he received a letter from the producers to be available for Superman II on July 16, which was only five days after he was to finish filming Somewhere in Time. In March 1979, the Salkinds filed suit against Reeve alleging he had breached his contract by walking off the sequel. Furthermore, Reeve had held reservations with Lester and the Newmans' script following the departure of Donner. During the renegotiation of his contract, Reeve agreed to the financial terms, but demanded more artistic control.\nThe remaining sequences left to be shot included the scenes of the super-villains in Midwest America and the battle in Metropolis, which were all shot by Lester. Gene Hackman, out of loyalty to Donner, declined to return for re-shoots, which necessitated the need for a stand-in actor and a voice double for several scenes. Filming for Superman II re-commenced in September 1979. As previously announced, Brando's scenes were removed and entirely re-shot with actress Susannah York. Throughout filming, Lester opted to retain his directorial technique for the three-camera setup while shooting scenes, which frustrated the actors as they did not know from where they were being filmed for their close-ups. However, Reeve noted that it made the production move at a faster pace. Filming was completed on March 10, 1980.\nComposer John Williams was flown to England to score the film in which he was given a screening with Ilya Salkind and Richard Lester. When Salkind left the projection room, Williams and Lester fell into an argument; when Salkind returned, Williams told him that he \"could not get along with this man.\" Ken Thorne was then selected to score the sequel. Before the film's release, Warner Bros. had appealed to the Directors Guild of America to assign the appropriate co-director credit, in which they argued Lester could not be credited unless he shot 40 percent of the film. Although Lester had earlier thought he would not be credited, he approached Donner to see if he wished to be credited as co-director, in which Donner replied, \"I don't share credit\".\nThe title was released in Europe and Australia on December 4, 1980, and June 19, 1981, in the United States. This version of Superman II combined Donner footage shot in 1977 with Lester footage shot in 1979. Approximately 30% of Lester's Superman II is Richard Donner's footage. In numerous scenes, the theatrical Superman II interweaves footage filmed years apart. Much of this interweaving was necessitated by Lex Luthor actor Gene Hackman's refusal to return to film any further scenes with Lester. Thus, all Hackman footage in the film is Donner's, although in certain scenes, a body double was used for wide shots re-filmed by Lester. In several instances, Lester re-staged Donner-filmed scenes, inserting certain newly filmed shots into pre-existing material. This is most evident during a scene in which the super-villains burst into the Daily Planet. The scene was filmed in its entirety by Donner in 1977. The Perry White office set was then partly re-built under Lester in 1979, the actors placed in exactly the same positions, costumes, etc., and new material filmed and inserted into the final film, despite the actors looking physically different.\n\n\n=== Donner footage in Superman II ===\nThe following is a list of all major Donner footage that was retained for Superman II:\n\nVarious shots of the Kryptonian villains on trial (Brando has been matted out)\nScenes from Superman: The Movie during the opening credits (except for hand-double shots replacing Brando)\nLex Luthor and Otis doing laundry in prison.\nThe three supervillains land on the Moon and kill the astronauts.\nLuthor escapes prison.\nLuthor and Tessmacher in the hot air balloon.\nLuthor and Tessmacher at the Fortress of Solitude (Kryptonian recordings filmed by Lester).\nThe three supervillains attack the White House and force the President to \"kneel before Zod\" (except for shots of the American flag falling, shot by Lester).\nA powerless Clark is beaten up by Rocky, a truck driver in a roadside diner (Donner appears as an extra in this sequence).\nLex Luthor visits the supervillains in the White House (except for the first two shots of the sequence, shot by Lester without Hackman).\nThe villains burst into the Daily Planet and chase after Superman (some close-ups are Lester footage).\nThe villains return to the Planet and decide to go to Superman's polar fortress (some close-ups are Lester footage).\nThe second part of the finale at the Fortress of Solitude, beginning with Luthor's belated arrival (some close-ups are Lester footage).\nSuperman returns Lois home.\nClark returns to the diner and gets his revenge on Rocky.\n\n\n=== Criticisms ===\n\nCritics of Lester's Superman II, including Donner, have stated that Lester's penchant for comedy undermined the integrity of the film, especially when compared to Donner's Superman. Examples of this trademark comedy are evident during scenes which feature Superman fighting the super-villains in Metropolis. The villains attack the citizens of Metropolis using super-breath. Several sight gags follow, including the wind blowing off a man's toupee, the ice cream being blown off of a cone and into someone's face, a man being blown over in a telephone booth and talking the whole time, a man with an umbrella being spun around as if dancing (parodying Singin' in the Rain) and a man on roller-skates rolling uncontrollably backwards across the pavement. Conversely, David Denby, reviewing the film for New York, praised the film's light approach and credited Lester for the film, particularly Hackman's performance. Mankiewicz shot back in a mailed letter writing, \"Just for the record, Gene Hackman never shot a foot of film with Lester and it was all written by me,\" but New York never issued a correction.\nDiscussions about the lost Donner footage raged for years. With the advent of the Internet, numerous letter-writing and other campaigns were instigated to persuade Warner Bros. to allow Richard Donner to create his version of Superman II. In 2004, the fan-restored DVD known as Superman II: Restored International Cut was released through many Superman fan sites. It featured extended scenes pulled from international TV broadcasts over the years. Warner Bros. threatened legal action over the bootleg release.\n\n\n=== Richard Donner cut ===\nWhen filming was suspended on Donner's Superman II in October 1977, the director had completed almost all of the major character-based sequences in the film. All scenes in the Daily Planet and most scenes set in the Fortress of Solitude were completed. All scenes featuring Marlon Brando, Ned Beatty, Jackie Cooper, Valerie Perrine and Gene Hackman were also completed. What remained to be filmed was the villains' arrival on Earth, and their rampage through mid-west America as well as exteriors at Washington, D.C., during which Zod announces his takeover of the Earth from the tip of the Washington Monument. Most of the battle scenes between Superman and the super-villains had yet to be shot, as well as both the interiors and exteriors at Niagara Falls, which had been planned to be shot during the Canadian shooting on Superman: The Movie, but was indefinitely postponed to make up for time and get the production back to England quicker. Several minor scenes including a love-struck Superman deliberately tilting over the Leaning Tower of Pisa (later adapted in Superman III) and a scene in which Superman warns off some English fox-hunters were also not filmed.\nThe Donner Cut features most of the completed but previously unseen scenes (some scenes have been deleted for narrative or dramatic reasons, while others are in alternate takes different from what had been seen in previous television cuts).  In many cases such scenes replace those re-filmed or altered by Lester. These include the original opening of the film set in the offices of the Daily Planet. In this opening, we see Lois trying to figure out the similarities between Clark Kent and Superman, followed by Perry White assigning Clark and Lois on the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls, and then Lois testing Clark / Superman by jumping off the balcony of one floor of the Daily Planet (a revised version of this scene appears in the Lester theatrical cut).\nA scene in a Niagara Falls hotel room, in which Lois tricks Clark into revealing he is Superman by shooting at him with a pistol loaded with blanks, is assembled from footage from Christopher Reeve's screen test, filmed with another actress (Holly Palance) as Lois. Footage from Margot Kidder's screen test for the same film was shot with the now-cast Christopher Reeve. Accordingly, Reeve's build, clothing, haircut, and eyeglasses are notably different from shot to shot.\n\n\n==== Creating the Donner Cut ====\nThe prospect of creating a Richard Donner cut did not begin to gain momentum until the 2001 DVD restoration of Superman. At the time, six tons of footage of each Superman film were discovered in vaults in England by Michael Thau, including much \"lost\" footage filmed by Donner. Soon after, Donner was approached by Warner Bros. to do an extended version of Superman II, but remained reluctant to revisit the movie. In May 2001, he told the website IGN: \"At the time, the studio wanted me to go back in and re-cut the film and add anything I wanted to add or do anything I wanted to do. Quite honestly, I was done with it. I was finished.\"\nNonetheless, fans continued to campaign for the film, including Birmingham, England native Dharmesh Chauhan who launched his website, supermancinema.co.uk, in which he petitioned for a release of the Richard Donner cut. In May 2004, the Planet of the Apes fansite TheForbidden-Zone.com launched an Internet campaign demanding Warner Bros. to allow Donner to release his version of Superman II in conjunction with the film's 25th anniversary. On June 19, 2004, the studio responded with the statement, \"Warner Home Video is supportive of an extended version of Superman II on DVD. However, there are complex legal issues that need to be resolved before the film can be re-released. Warner Home Video is presently addressing those issues.\" That same month, Margot Kidder said in an interview for Starlog: \"There's a whole other Superman II in a vault somewhere, with scenes of Chris and me that have never seen the light of day. It's far better than the one that was released.\"\nOther than Donner's reluctance to re-visit the project, these legal issues were the greatest obstacle towards creating a Donner cut. The required footage was still owned by the Salkinds, and issues of using Brando's filmed footage in Superman II remained unresolved. In March 2005, it was speculated that archive footage of Brando would be used in the then-upcoming sequel Superman Returns (2006). Later, in November 2006, Donner Cut producer Michael Thau told American Cinematographer magazine, \"Marlon Brando's estate made a deal with Warner Bros. to license some of his footage for Superman Returns. This later led to the studio going back to his estate for our re-cut of Superman II. If that footage couldn't be used, it wasn't worth doing the project.\"\nWork began on the project in late 2005, though without Donner's involvement. Thau explained Donner's reluctance to involve himself was because he was preoccupied with directing 16 Blocks (2006) at the time. In January 2006, Donner told IGN: \"They're doing it. I'm not doing it... I don't even want to see it until it comes out in the theater... I'm too far away from it now.\" A month later, when asked about the new Superman II cut, Donner told the website Dark Horizons that Thau was \"recutting my picture and again, he's asked me would I help. I can't because it's so long ago and the little bit of footage that I looked at, I would never shoot like that now in a million years, I mean it was a different way, a different style, different interpretation.\"\n\nThroughout the years, Donner had frequently proclaimed diametrically opposing views with regards to the possibility of re-assembling his Superman II \u2013 often stating that he would like to do it, other times stating that he would not. In June 2006, Thau stated, \"Dick was beginning to free up from 16 Blocks and I would try to lure him into the cutting room with 'Here Dick here's a piece of candy, come take a look' and then he started warming up to the project.\" Sometime later, Thau confirmed that Donner had decided on a far closer involvement with the project, also bringing in Tom Mankiewicz to assist. In an interview with the magazine Movie Magic, he stated, \"When I'd get a cut on a scene, I'd show it to Dick and he'd say, 'I don't like that line; that reading's not good,' and so on. With Dick it's always, 'Make it move faster.\"\nOverall, The Donner Cut comprises Donner's Superman II scenes edited by Stuart Baird in 1977\u201378, 1980 Superman II theatrical scenes cut by John Victor Smith, as well as a large amount of new material edited by Michael Thau. The new cut reportedly used less than 20 percent of the footage shot by Lester.\nIn a June 2006 interview with Amazon.com, George Feltenstein, senior vice president of Warner Home Video's Catalog Marketing division, stated:\n\nWe have been getting for years and years and years letters begging us to release the Donner cut of Superman II, and this year we bit the bullet and we've created what is ostensibly a new film, although the footage is all footage that was shot years and years and years ago. But it was sitting in a lab and never assembled. And for those of us were very saddened and touched by the loss of Christopher Reeve \u2013 to see footage you've never seen of him before, and a whole different take on the Superman II story, is really thrilling.\nDonner contacted composer John Williams about creating a new score for his version of the film, but Williams was unable to help out, as he had also turned down a similar request by Superman Returns director Bryan Singer because he was scoring Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005). Donner reused Williams' music (along with unreleased and unused cues) from the first film, while still retaining a small amount of Ken Thorne's score, subsequently relegating Thorne to the closing credits for \"additional music\", and the new opening title sequence gives Williams' composing credit.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOn Friday, July 21, 2006, extended exclusive footage from the Donner Cut was screened during a panel at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con. The hour-long panel, titled \"Warner Home Video's Superman Through the Ages\", included a Q&A with Donner, Mankiewicz, Thau, and actors Marc McClure and Jack O'Halloran.\n\n\n=== World premiere ===\nThe world premiere of The Donner Cut was screened on November 2, 2006, at the Directors Guild of America building in Hollywood. It was attended by several members of the cast and crew, including Donner, Ilya Salkind, Mankiewicz, Kidder, Sarah Douglas, O'Halloran, and McClure. After the screening, they participated in a panel discussion. On November 25, 2006, an exclusive screening benefit for Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut was held at the Fine Arts Theatre in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nOn November 28, 2006, the film was released on DVD, Blu-Ray, and HD DVD, which featured an optional introduction by director Richard Donner and an audio commentary by Donner and Mankiewicz. Additionally, the release included a new making-of featurette titled Superman II: Restoring the Vision and six deleted scenes.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut an approval rating of 90% based on 10 reviews with an average rating of 7.6 out of 10. In comparison, the theatrical cut of Superman II received an approval rating of 83% based on 58 reviews with an average rating of 7.4 out of 10.\nKenneth Sweeney, writing in American Cinematographer magazine, praised the DVD release, noting that \"Donner's take on the narrative events of Superman II is unusual and fascinating. This version includes a longer prologue, deletes many of Lester's campy sequences, and offers a more consistent balance between adventure and romance.\" He concluded that \"[t]his exciting, one-of-a-kind DVD is really a joy to behold for longtime fans of the Superman franchise, and is a must for all fans of the superhero genre.\" Todd Gilchrist of IGN gave The Donner Cut a score of 9 out of 10, writing \"the film itself is a remarkable artistic accomplishment\". Vic Holtreman, reviewing for Screen Rant, praised The Donner Cut as superior to the theatrical version, but lamented that \"there is still almost all of the silly humor that was in the first Superman film and the original release of Superman II.\"\nIn his book Superman vs Hollywood, Jake Rossen wrote, \"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut is neither a better nor a worse film than its first incarnation. Lester's labored slapstick has been all but excised, and Brando's presence certainly elevates the melodrama surrounding Clark's conflict over becoming 'human.' But incorporating the unpolished audition footage is jarring; ultimately, the edit is simply a curiosity.\" Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the film a C+, concluding, \"It's nice to see the Brando footage and the restored scenes of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder's breezy chemistry. But where the original cut at least played as a relatively cohesive movie, loose ends and all, this looks like little but loose ends. It's a curio, not a corrective.\"\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSuperman II: The Richard Donner Cut received an award at the 33rd Saturn Awards in the category of Best DVD Special Edition Release.\n\n\n== See also ==\nZack Snyder's Justice League\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMankiewicz, Tom; Crane, Robert (2012).

            "Swamp Thing is a 1982 American superhero film written and directed by Wes Craven, based on the DC Comics character of the same name created by Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson. It tells the story of scientist Alec Holland (Ray Wise) who is transformed into the monster known as Swamp Thing (Dick Durock) through laboratory sabotage orchestrated by the evil Anton Arcane (Louis Jourdan). Later, he helps a woman named Alice Cable (Adrienne Barbeau) and battles the man responsible for it all, the ruthless Arcane. The film did well on home video and cable and was followed by a sequel, The Return of Swamp Thing, in 1989.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a scientist is mysteriously killed while assisting a top-secret bioengineering project, government worker Alice Cable arrives at the bogs to serve as his replacement. Alice immediately notices that one of the team's swamp sensors has malfunctioned and Harry Ritter reveals that her predecessor was attempting to repair it when he was killed. Charlie tells Ritter a rumor about an evil paramilitary leader named Anton Arcane, who intends to hijack their operation. Alice introduces herself to Dr. Linda Holland and her brother, lead scientist Dr. Alec Holland, who takes her on a tour and encourages her to admire the beauty of the swamps.\nAfter noting the disappearance of one of their workers, the group hears a loud bang and returns to the laboratory, where Linda shows off her recent breakthrough: a glowing, plant-based concoction with explosive properties. Sometime later, Alec notices that droplets of Linda's formula spawned rapid plant growth on the surfaces they touched. Suddenly, a group of paramilitary agents attack her and raid Alec's laboratory. A man resembling Ritter steps forward, but pulls off his mask and reveals himself as Arcane. When Arcane shoots Linda for attempting to escape with the formula, Alec grabs the beaker, but trips, causing the spilled chemicals to set him on fire. He runs outside and dives into the swamp to extinguish the flames as a series of explosions burst from the water.\nOvernight, Arcane's henchmen destroy the premises and remove all evidence of the team's work. At dawn, a henchman captures Alice and attempts to drown her in the swamp, but a green, humanlike creature rescues her. Meanwhile, in his mansion, Arcane and his secretary realize that Alec's most recent notebook is missing. Alice runs to a nearby gas station to telephone her employers for help; the operator connects her to Arcane, who, posing as Ritter, claims to have been called away from the site before the attack. After revealing she stole Alec's last notebook, Alice waits for Ritter's return alongside the young gas station attendant, Jude, but Arcane's men arrive and chase her through the forest. Suddenly, the green humanoid creature, referred to as the Swamp Thing, appears and again scares the pursuers away and Alice escapes.\nAlice and Jude boat around the swamp until they reach the dock near the laboratory wreckage. Multiple boats of Arcane's men close in on Alice and Jude, luring the creature from its hiding place among the reeds. Despite their bullets and grenades, the Swamp Thing engineers an elaborate boat crash. Moments after instructing Jude to escape with Alec's notebook, Alice hears the boy cry out in distress, but she is kidnapped before she can reply. The Swamp Thing finds Jude's lifeless body and presses a hand against his head, creating a greenish glow which instantly revives him. Regaining consciousness, Jude realizes the creature is a friend of Alice's and gives it the notebook for safekeeping. On Arcane's boat, Alice throws her kidnapper, Ferret, overboard, then dives into the water and swims ashore. Once on land, Alice bumps into the Swamp Thing, which calls out her name. Ferret chops off the Swamp Thing's arm with a machete, but the creature easily crushes Ferret's skull, causing Alice to faint. She awakens in the monster's embrace. The Swamp Thing speaks to her, and she recognizes it as Alec. Arcane's men follow her, capture the Swamp Thing in a net, and retrieve the final notebook.\nThat evening, Arcane invites Alice to a formal dinner party celebrating his duplication of the Hollands\u2019 formula. Moments after giving a toast to prospective immortality, Arcane reveals that he secretly slipped the first dose to Bruno, who begins to convulse. The hulking man's body shrinks to half its size as he grows pointed ears and a misshapen skull. Arcane locks him in a dungeon alongside the Swamp Thing, asking the latter why the experiment failed. The Swamp Thing reveals that the formula does not produce strength, but instead amplifies a person's natural qualities, explaining that Bruno's timidity caused his diminished stature.\nAfter locking Alice in the dungeon with them, Arcane returns to his study and drinks a glass of the formula. A beam of sunlight emitted through the door re-grows the Swamp Thing's missing arm, allowing the creature to free itself, Alice, and Bruno. Upstairs, Arcane transforms into a hairy, boar like beast, and descends to the dungeons. There, he discovers that his captives have escaped through an underwater tunnel leading back to the swamp. Sometime later, Alice and the Swamp Thing emerge from the water, followed closely by Arcane, who stabs Alice with a sword. The Swamp Thing revives Alice then kills Arcane. The creature turns to leave, but Alice pleads for him to stay so that she can help him rebuild his work. He refuses, but promises to return to her soon. Moments later, Jude emerges from the trees and embraces her as they watch the Swamp Thing lumber away through the marsh.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRay Wise as Alec Holland: A scientist developing a formula that will allow for plants to grow in inhospitable environments.\nDick Durock portrays Holland as the Swamp Thing.\nAdrienne Barbeau as Alice Cable: A researcher brought in to help with the project, and the only survivor following Arcane's attack on the scientists.

Wes Craven was very proud in delivering the film on time and on budget at $2.5 million.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nIn writing the film, Wes Craven referenced Werner Herzog's 1974 film The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser which was originally called Every Man for Himself and God Against All. Another mercenary says the line to the character named Bruno. In Enigma, the lead character was played by Bruno Schleinstein (credited as Bruno S.).\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nSwamp Thing was released on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD and Blu-ray.\nIn August 2000, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the film on DVD in the United States. Though the DVD was labeled as being the PG-rated, domestic cut of the film, MGM had inadvertently used the 93-minute international cut of the film which contained more nudity and sexual content than the US theatrical cut. This DVD edition also erroneously lists the release date as 1981, instead of 1982. In May 2002, a Dallas woman rented the disc from a Blockbuster Video store for her children and reported this discrepancy. MGM recalled the disc and reissued it in August 2005, with the US theatrical cut as originally intended.\nSwamp Thing was released in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack by Shout! Factory on August 6, 2013. The set features the 91-minute cut of the film presented in high definition widescreen format, along with bonus content including interviews with Adrienne Barbeau, Len Wein, and Reggie Batts, as well as commentary tracks with Wes Craven and makeup artist Bill Munn.\nIn the UK the 93-minute cut was released on Blu-ray by 88films on March 25, 2019.\nMVD Entertainment Group released an Ultra HD Blu-ray edition of Swamp Thing in 2023, which includes both versions of the film.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nSwamp Thing received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Unabashedly campy -- often to its detriment -- Swamp Thing is not without its charms, among them Adrienne Barbeau as the damsel in distress\". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars.\nAuthor John Kenneth Muir notes that Swamp Thing differs in many respects from Craven's usual work, in that Craven's intent was to show the major Hollywood studios that he could handle action, stunts and major stars. Craven substituted his usual focus on the problems of family and society for pure entertainment. Nevertheless, Muir points out that some of Craven's usual themes and images do appear in Swamp Thing. For example, as in The Last House on the Left (1972), and The Hills Have Eyes (1977), Craven shows a close connection between the landscape and his characters.\nPopMatters journalist J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III wrote: \"As much fun as this film can be (and it often is), it's equally often difficult to ignore that Swamp Thing ultimately is, at core, a rubber-suit monster movie\".\nDVD Talk rated the film as 3 stars of 5 stars as \"Recommended\".\n\n\n== Other media ==\n\n\n=== Comic book adaptation ===\nThe film was adapted in comic form as Swamp Thing Annual #1. The adaptation was written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Mark Texeira and Tony DeZuniga.\n\n\n=== Sequel ===\nA sequel entitled The Return of Swamp Thing was released in 1989.\n\n\n=== Television series ===\nIn July 1990, USA Network premiered the Swamp Thing television series. This saw Dick Durock reprising his role using a modified version of the Return of Swamp Thing costume. The series took a deliberate turn away from the campy themes of its 1989 film predecessor and leaned toward the darkness of Wes Craven's version. It lasted into 1993 with a total of 72 episodes.\n\n\n=== Animated series ===\nA short-lived animated series was also produced concurrently. It does not share continuity with either the films or live-action series.\n\n\n=== Cancelled Reboot and Upcoming Reboot ===\nIn 2009, Joel Silver announced plans to produce a reboot of the Swamp Thing film franchise from a story written by Akiva Goldsman. In April 2010, Vincenzo Natali was confirmed to direct, but in May he decided to delay the Swamp Thing reboot to pursue other projects.\nIn January 2023, a new reboot was announced as part of the DC Universe (DCU) by James Gunn.\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\nAdrienne Barbeau made a guest appearance in the episode \"Long Walk Home\" of DC Universe's 2019 Swamp Thing series.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwamp Thing at IMDb\nSwamp Thing at AllMovie\nSwamp Thing at the TCM Movie Database\nSwamp Thing at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nSwamp Thing at Rotten Tomatoes\nSwamp Thing at Box Office Mojo",
